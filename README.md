# Master of Artificial Intelligence applied to Sports

This repo contains all the projects done for the AI applied to Sports Master done in SportsDataCampus.

By now, the repo only contains the first task of Module 1: Infographics of an AI-driven application related to Sports. In my case, it is about MaxOne's SmartCoach app.
