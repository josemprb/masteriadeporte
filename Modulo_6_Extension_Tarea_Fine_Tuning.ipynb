            "Review: I really liked this Summerslam due to the look of the arena, the curtains and just the look overall was interesting to me for some reason. Anyways, this could have been one of the best Summerslam's ever if the WWF didn't have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, now for it's time it was ok to have a huge fat man vs a strong man but I'm glad times have changed. It was a terrible main event just like every match Luger is in is terrible. Other matches on the card were Razor Ramon vs Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs Curt Hening, this was the event where Shawn named his big monster of a body guard Diesel, IRS vs 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart first takes on Doink then takes on Jerry Lawler and stuff with the Harts and Lawler was always very interesting, then Ludvig Borga destroyed Marty Jannetty, Undertaker took on Giant Gonzalez in another terrible match, The Smoking Gunns and Tatanka took on Bam Bam Bigelow and the Headshrinkers, and Yokozuna defended the world title against Lex Luger this match was boring and it has a terrible ending. However it deserves 8/10\n",
            "Review: Not many television shows appeal to quite as many different kinds of fans like Farscape does...I know youngsters and 30/40+ years old;fans both Male and Female in as many different countries as you can think of that just adore this T.V miniseries. It has elements that can be found in almost every other show on T.V, character driven drama that could be from an Australian soap opera; yet in the same episode it has science fact & fiction that would give even the hardiest \"Trekkie\" a run for his money in the brainbender stakes! Wormhole theory, Time Travel in true equational form...Magnificent. It embraces cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are endless having multiple stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose from.<br /><br />With such a broad scope; it would be expected that nothing would be able to keep up the illusion for long, but here is where \"Farscape\" really comes into it's own element...It succeeds where all others have failed, especially the likes of Star Trek (a universe with practically zero Kaos element!) They ran out of ideas pretty quickly + kept rehashing them! Over the course of 4 seasons they manage to keep the audience's attention using good continuity and constant character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain character groups within the whole. This structure allows for an extremely large area of subject matter as loyalties are forged and broken in many ways on many many issues. I happened to see the pilot (Premiere) in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if Crichton would ever \"Get the girl\", after seeing them all on television I was delighted to see them available on DVD & I have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me sane whilst I had to do a 12 hour night shift and developed chronic insomnia...Farscape was the only thing to get me through those extremely long nights...<br /><br />Do yourself a favour; Watch the pilot and see what I mean...<br /><br />Farscape Comet\n",
            "Review: The film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction. The first really bad thing is the guy hijacking Steven Seagal would have been beaten to pulp by Seagal's driving, but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie.<br /><br />It seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot, so just plan to enjoy the action, and do not expect a coherent plot. Turn any sense of logic you may have, it will reduce your chance of getting a headache.<br /><br />I does give me some hope that Steven Seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies.\n",
            "Review: Jane Austen would definitely approve of this one!<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of Emma. She is funny without being excessively silly, yet elegant. She puts on a very convincing British accent (not being British myself, maybe I'm not the best judge, but she fooled me...she was also excellent in \"Sliding Doors\"...I sometimes forget she's American ~!). <br /><br />Also brilliant are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (Emma Thompson's sister and mother) as the Bates women. They nearly steal the show...and Ms. Law doesn't even have any lines!<br /><br />Highly recommended.\n"

            "Review: hands down, the best drama comedy show on television. a cleverly written show about a young mother and her year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. lorelai gilmore lauren graham struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through out the show is becoming harder and harder. rory gilmore alexis bledel caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both. with the help of luke danes scott patterson and sookie st.james melissa mccarthy and an enormous variety of other hilarious characters, this show easily remains one of my favorites. what really puts the show over the top is the complex yet, incredible and witty writing often using references from pop culture to the mink dynasty.\n",

            "Review: this is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics, and is a must see for all psychotronic fans. why it has everything a great s exploitation film should have. over the top dialog, bad acting, enthusiasm, sex, sleaze, political incorrectness, violence, and many other elements of a good cult classic are included. in other words, dolemite is a must see. br br as with a lot of these films, the plot makes little to no sense. what i picked up from it is that pimp hustler dolemite got framed up for having stolen furs and half a million dollars worth of narcotics. while he was doing time, his arch nemesis willie green the same man who framed him took over his nightclub. however, the sympathetic warden the only white character in the whole movie that isn t completely evil or incompetent decides to spring him free to stop the evil willie green and his drug trafficking. luckily, he knows kung fu, as does about to of the characters in this film do. and even more luckily, while he was locked up, the madam queen bee sent all his hoes to kung fu school. with this army of kung fu fighting hoes his words, not mine on his side, he plans to take back the nightclub from willie green. however, two racist white cops try to frame him up again and have him thrown back in jail. br br as i said earlier, don t try to follow the plot. i ve seen this movie about five times and there are many elements that seem to have no connections to anything else. supporting characters wander in and out of the film. i m still attempting to figure out what was up with reverend gibbs, the mayor, and the hamburger pimp. who cares ultimately the scenes with these characters are all priceless. as for the dialog, its horrible with even worse delivery. since rudy ray moore was originally a comedian, i begin to wonder if this film was meant to be a spoof or a serious action film. it seems he couldn t decide which one. lines such as yeah, i m so bad, i kick my own ass twice a day call for further investigation. either way, the film is hilarious, and the plot has more holes than a swiss cheese factory. another hilarious element is some of the most unerotic uses of sex and nudity ever in film. actors that you would never want to see naked get naked including the mayor and queen bee . not to mention the fact that the boom mic seems to show up in every other scene. br br most of all, moore shows incredible enthusiasm. he seems to be having a generally good time and is certainly charismatic. his comedy raps proved to be a huge influence on latter day gangsta rap, including dr. dre who sampled him on his groundbreaking album the chronic . as technically inept as the film is, it is culturally influential. even more important, it is an all around good time. the biggest crime an exploitation film can commit is being boring, and this for all its flaws is quickly paced and entertaining. in other words, if you dig this kind of film, you ll love dolemite . if you don t dig it, you re a no business, born insecure, jock jawed motha f a \n",

            "Review: i ve been waiting years for the dead to come out on video, having pretty much worn my vhs copy to shreds. this is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays. it takes place on the feast of the epiphany twelfth night , and is a simple, poignant vignette of characters attending a dinner prepared by three dublin women. central to the story is a fairly loveless couple, a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife, but feels incapable. all of the performances are stunning, and the script weaves among the various characters at the dinner beautifully. of course, its source material is james joyce s short story of the same title, and much of his narrative structure is kept fully intact. john huston s long career as one of hollywood s greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting finale with this film, which was scripted by his son, tony huston stars his daughter, anjelica huston and is dedicated to his wife, maricella. thank you to lions gate for picking up the rights to this film and releasing it on dvd. for lovers of all things irish or for folks looking for a literate, subtle, yet incredibly moving holiday film, this is a true gem.\n",

            "Review: as i sit back after watching wong kar wai s movie ashes of time more specifically the re edit and re release with the word redux slapped on the end of the title i wonder what went wrong. i wonder why the film just didn t work out at all. i wonder why the movie failed to score any major points in my book. in particular, what was it about the film which dragged it down, and made it the director s worst film of his career br br well it s not too hard to figure out really. let me just say that it truly is a shame that kar wai so abruptly went down this hell hole of mediocrity and poorness in moviedom, especially considering the fact that in the same year he released chungking express, one of his enduring legacies and an absolutely sublime film. so what went wrong it would be suitable to consider ashes of time as somewhat of an experimental film. our director essentially places his own inimitable style of film making and places it in an entirely different setting, mood and atmosphere what results is a catastrophic film which is all over the place and simply does not work out. hence, it would be even wiser to call ashes of time a failed experiment. bold, audacious and innovative, but a failure nonetheless. br br let me elaborate. those who have seen the films of mr. kar wai, a hong kong born film auteur who s made his mark on the art house world since his debut in the late s, will know that there is an overriding aesthetic which binds all of his movies together essentially and frankly speaking, they re all colourful, thought provoking, amiable, subtly humorous and meaningful evocations of life, love and loss. the same formula is transposed into ashes of time however, the regular setting of hong kong is ridden of, and in its stead we re placed into the setting of ancient china, and the land of the legendary martial arts warriors and clansmen. br br intertwined into this quasi adventure historical caper is the typical kar wai love story, this time involving an elegiac hit man who has moved to the middle of the desert, and is carrying out contract killings. however, i must stop myself there description of characters is a useless thing to do. why because not a single character in ashes of time is worth mentioning or nothing. what a bland cast, and what a waste of talent the case of ashes of time contains nearly all regular kar wai collaborators . br br not only that, but the film is essentially endless incessant rambling in a horrendous, almost non existent narrative structure. one of the main reasons why detractors of ashes of time berate it is because it seems to possess no plot whatsoever, let alone a semblance or an indication of one. you can definitely see what they re getting at, even from the first two, three minutes, maybe less, of the film. perhaps it s just the atypical setting of ancient china which is unaccustomed and inappropriate for kar wai s typical film making style. i like to think, however unfortunate it may be, that mr. kar wai just stuffed up big time here. br br one thing that a reviewer can actually compliment in ashes of time, albeit said compliment being starkly isolated, is another director trademark wonderful, colourful and blissful aesthetics. what joyous colour is composed on screen, what glorious textures are painted for us, and what breathtaking landscapes and imagery are captured for us throughout the entire movie. we can at least take this as a sign that wong kar wai is still there at heart, and it s just the film which is so atypical, and buries his usually commendable nuance. although the visuals aren t enough for us to fully absolve kar wai for this disastrous venture, they re enough to make the film worthwhile and at least we don t walk out of the movie in a completely and totally cantankerous mood, now that there s something we can think of nicely. br br the film is essentially a wuxia art film, following in the style of, say, legendary japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa. however, one thing differentiates kar wai s film from kurosawa s best, and that s that in the japanese director s films everything gels together and simply works. in ashes of time, nothing seems to work. kar wai s attempt to make a genuinely profound wuxia film, let alone an intellectual and provocative movie in general terms, is a futile endeavour. br br kar wai claims that making ashes of time exhausted him, and that he needed time to clear his head. it must ve certainly been a fatiguing effort on his behalf, as his exertions are embodied in the film and transferred to us directly i mean, just watching the film is an exhausting effort, and now i need time to clear my head of this unpleasant movie going experience.\n",

            "Review: for those of you who ve never heard of it or seen it on a e , cracker is a brilliant british tv show about an overweight, chain smoking, foulmouthed psychologist named fitz who helps the manchester police department get into the heads of violent criminals. it s considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of england and that s saying something , and was tremendously successful in england and around the world back in . br br now, the original stars have re teamed with the original writer to knock out one more hour episode. i ve loved this show ever since i d first seen it, over a decade ago. the dvd box set holds a place of honor in my collection, and i can quote a good deal of fitz s interrogation scenes practically word for word. the idea of robbie coltrane reteaming with jimmy mcgovern for another tv movie about fitz filled me with absolute glee. br br i ll start with the good. one of the many things that impressed me about the original cracker series was how quickly fitz was defined as a character. five minutes into the first episode with his lecture throwing the books into the air , his drinking, and his cussing of the guy after him on the gambling machine queue and you knew, simply knew, who this character was. you could feel him clicking in your mind, the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writer. br br coltrane, of course, remained great throughout the show, but i always felt that some of the later episodes those not written by mcgovern mistreated the character. br br so the good news is this fitz is back. as soon as you see him in this show making incredibly inappropriate comments at his daughter s wedding you ll feel that click once again. it s him petulant one moment and truly sorry the next, always insightful, sincere to the point of tactlessness but brilliantly funny in the process. if you love this character as much as i do, you ll be delighted with how he is portrayed in the movie. and this extends to judith and mark in fact, everything having to do with the fitzs is handled perfectly. br br the problem i do have with this movie revolves around the crime fitz is trying to solve. in standard cracker fashion, we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes the suspense lies in seeing fitz figure it out. in this case, we have a serial killer who is out for american blood. and the reason for this, unfortunately, is not due to any believable psychological trauma rather, it seems that the murders are here simply to allow the writer to display his personal political beliefs. br br it s difficult for me to write this, as i truly believe that jimmy mcgovern is one of the greatest writers in the world. nor do i have a problem with movies that are about current issues, or movies that take a political stand. but in the cracker universe, we expect to see the characters behaving like human beings, not like caricatures. instead, the americans in this movie are all depicted in an entirely stereotypical fashion. they re know nothing loudmouths who complain about everything, treat the locals like crap and cheat on their wives one of them even manages to do all of the above within less than minutes. i honestly thought i d mistakenly switched channels or something. br br but it doesn t stop there. we get constant reminders of just how badly the war in iraq is going reminders that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story and appear practically out of nowhere. the killer is so busy ranting about how bush is worse than hitler that he almost forgets to get on with the killing but more to the point, he is such a mouthpiece for the writer s political views that he forgets to act like a believable human being, and thus we as an audience don t buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man to a tortured serial killing soul. br br i can t say that this ruined the show for me it s was still good tv, better than almost everything else in the genre mainly due to, once again, coltrane . but its constant politicizing made it impossible for it to be as good as the real cracker classics like to be a somebody an episode that was just as issuey , but one that was handled with far more subtlety and psychological depth. br br two other small points panhandle not being around is a disappointment, but what s worse are her replacements. the entire police department which for so long filled with such great characters is now full of vanilla. completely interchangeable cops who lack any and all personality how you could drain coupling s richard coyle of personality is beyond me, but it is indeed missing here . br br also, there are couple of moments where the show lost its believability for me. one such instance revolves around fitz having to narrow down the entire population of manchester from million to a hundred based on some very strange criteria french windows how does the computer know if i have french windows he not only succeeds in doing this, but he succeeds in less than an hour. i don t think so. br br so, all in all, i was a little disappointed. it s recommended viewing, but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door. still, if there s new series to come after this, it would all have been for the good i m convinced that mcgovern can still write great stuff, and maybe now that he s got his politics out of his system he can go back to writing about people.\n",

            "Review: belushi at his most ingratiating and courtney cox before friends has a small role. i often think belushi is under used in hollywood and this film role is one of his best. for those of you who watch his tv show, this is a very different and likable character. the movie itself is not earth shattering, nor is the message new but rather it is sweet and endearing. the supporting cast of familiar faces and unfamiliar names is a perfect balance although lovitz s whining can get tiresome, and michael caine s charming spiritual guide has a slightly sinister if not well meaning edge. hamilton, as belushi s wife is unfortunately two dimensional and one wonders why he married her. in addition, renee russo is wasted and not terribly convincing at the prom queen who got away. nevertheless, a nice way to spend two hours.\n",

            "Review: i was not expecting much from this movie, but was very pleasantly surprised, as it is light and funny and very well observed. the central trio of deadbeat bikers were surprisingly likable as they staggered and clowned their way through their drug centred trip to wales. the humour was gentle and subtle, as indeed were the three characters witness their sympathetic treatment of the little old lady shopkeeper . the atmospherics of rural wales were captured perfectly, and the soundtrack was very well chosen. cleverly and carefully scripted, with great attention to detail i have never seen such a realistic portrayal of alternative culture i felt i was there with them. very light in touch and full of fun not what you might expect from a movie about bikers and drugs. a delight on all fronts, and difficult to criticise, though i thought the last two scenes were a bit lame the film should have ended when they left wales. but overall, an unexpected treasure of a film.\n",

            "Review: a lot of things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically funny than actually funny though it does have some laugh out loud moments but a lot of that is because it seems to have been cut by the studio to better appeal to exactly the idiots it s mocking. many situations aren t allowed to develop, there s obvious overdubbing of expository material, and worst of all a narrator explains everything most of which needs no explanation , probably because some preview audience didn t understand what was going on. in other words, a movie about dumbing down has been... you guessed it. br br one hopes that a longer, better version of this comedy will eventually surface on dvd, and it will become the cult fave it deserves to be, but even in this mutilated and somewhat comic spirit diminished form it s one of the more memorable films of the year a screech of disgust against our culture and all the ways it s become trashified, stupidified and uglified in the name of appealing to the yahoos. i watched it right after land of the dead, george romero s latest milking of the single idea that consumers zombies, which is basically the same point judge is making yet where romero s counterculture viewpoint now zombies underclass that needs to revolt against the rich seems hopelessly out of date, judge s take is fresh, dead on and far more disturbing. just listen to the yahoos in your movie audience whooping it up for president camacho s state of the union just like their counterparts on screen, and you ll know that we re all doomed.\n",

            "Review: i just finished watching dressed to kill,which is written and directed by brian de palma.the dvd had both the r rated version and the unrated version.i chose the unrated version.since i have yet to view the r rated version,i can t be completely sure of the difference.there is however a very graphic graphic female nudity including a scene of explicit expression of self gratification in this version.i guess you could call this scene soft core porn.if this sort of thing may offend you,i would suggest you view the r rated version.but i digress.any comment from here on refers to the unrated version.this is a murder mystery psychological horror suspense movie.there is very little violence and blood.there is however one death sequence of note.the act of the killing itself is fairly graphic.however the blood it self does not look real.it is reminiscent of how a s slasher film would look.i believe this is done deliberately to offset the violence of the act itself,to give the scene a low budget feel.most of the violence,or rather possibility of such,is implied.the film is very well paced.as far as i can tell every scene had a purpose,which i find very rare when compared to many of today s films. anyway,i also thought the acting was good,especially angie dickinson.and micheal cane turns in a quietly understated performance in his role,which works brilliantly in this case.the movie also has one great twist in it,in my mind,although some people might find it predictable.the only complaint and it s really more of an observation i have is that i thought the character played by nancy allen could have been fleshed out more,especially considering she has a fair amount of screen time.but i think she does a good job with what she is given.and this doesn t really take away from the quality of the film.the film also has a strong moral to it,which is even more relevant today.but the movie doesn t hit you over the head with it.i also really liked the musical score,composed by pino dinaggioi felt it was very similar to the music in the original psycho.to me,this music really elevated the movie.i thought this movie was brilliant.for me,dressed to kill is \n",

            "Review: this is arguably the best film director haim bouzaglo made until now. a skilled tv director, well trained in story telling and in directing his actors through long epics he tried to catch in this very low budget film the essence of the very special psychological situation the israelis live though under the permanent danger of the terror attacks, resulting in distorted lives. each character trying to live his own life, to watch and control the other, while being himself watched and controlled by other characters and mostly by the continuous pressure, by political and historical forces well beyond his control. some call this destiny, but destiny has a very concrete representation in this film. br br there is no explicit political saying in distortion . characters never discuss politics, not even at the level of saying bastards when they hear that a new terror attack happens. their reaction to events is to localize the attack and to count the victims using the official and media terminology for the dead and the wounded. they do not really live but rather survive on borrowed time happy to have survived one bomb, and waiting for the next one to happen. personal, social, professional life seems to work someway, but is deeply flawed and influenced by events. the main character played by the director is a playwright whose mid life personal and creative crisis is amplified by the pressure of the events and by the fact that he is lucky enough to leave a terror attack site minutes before the bomb explodes. he hires a private detective to follow his girlfriend who is a tv investigative reporter whom he suspects is falling in for the subject of her next show another failed man, former military, whose business and family life dismantles under the events. he starts to write a play that carbon copies the reality and will bring it to the stage, in theater in film scene that reminds hamlet as well as synecdoche, new york . it s not that i would dare suspect charlie kaufman looking over the shoulder of bouzaglo, he certainly needs not that, but the israeli director screen is brilliant into anticipating the later film and the first directed by kaufman . as in the american film actors play real persons and start interacting with them in an reality meets stage meets reality melange which never lacks logic, at least not artistic logic. br br bouzaglo directs his actors with the usual talent, trusts them and allows them the freedom of living through the situations rather then acting them. his style is much more free here than in his tv series, and the distortion effects, although borrowed from american horror movies work pretty well all over. the ending seemed to me a little rhetorical and unsatisfying dramatically, but the shade of the suicidal killer who is haunting the film and the whole situation in a temporal loop will also follow the viewer when remembering later this film.\n",

            "Review: rita hayworth as rusty parker is the cover girl du jour she s one of the dancing girls in danny mcguire s club, the most special one according to danny gene kelly and pretty much anyone who comes across her. take for example, vanity magazine magnate john coudair otto kruger enchanted by rusty s resemblance to her grandmother maribelle also played by hayworth in flashbacks , whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her, he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and maribelle. he doesn t believe that danny could give rusty happiness, or everything she should be entitled to he even gets danny believing this himself. when rusty shoots to fame as vanity s cover girl , danny drives her away into the ready and waiting arms of noel wheaton lee bowman . so what happens when danny returns to town with his sidekick genius phil silvers in tow, only to discover that rusty is marrying wheaton br br as a musical, cover girl benefits from the beautiful score and songs written by jerome kern and ira gershwin, including the oscar nominated long ago and far away possibly one of the most gorgeous ballads ever written and beautifully, sweetly sung as a duet by hayworth and kelly , maribelle s number sure thing the more lacklustre poor john isn t a kern gershwin collaboration and put me to the test . the dancing, of course, is top notch, since gene kelly had more than just a hand in the choreography. it shows in the simplest of dances, for example his dance with hayworth to put me to the test , or the joyfully exuberant make way for tomorrow number performed by the trio of danny, rusty and genius ... which foreshadows the reaction gene s character has to the police cop in the title number in singin in the rain. kelly especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the alter ego dance. like its successors in anchors aweigh and an american in paris jerry the mouse and the minute ballet respectively , this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity kelly brought to the modern film musical wanting to use the film medium to present dances that couldn t be showcased on a stage, and years before cgi, kelly insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly match him in talent and style himself. the number is hardly five minutes long, but it and kelly s genius still takes one s breath away, even sixty years down the line. this is the reason i watched cover girl, and if nothing else, this dance is truly worth it. br br you can tell that a great deal of money was lavished onto cover girl and rita hayworth not that she doesn t deserve it. witness the scene when rusty hits broadway the large screen showcasing all the different cover girls gives way to a staggeringly large stage rigged for rusty s entrance. hayworth is indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on show in the film, and she dances with a style and grace that is almost worthy of kelly. very few of kelly s co stars have that honour. she is hilarious in some scenes, for example her drunk scene when john and wheaton come to get her from joe s. br br for some reason, however, her performance still lacks the spark of greatness which would help cover girl overcome its general curse of mediocrity. that curse is only lifted whenever gene kelly is on the screen dancing or no , or when eve arden as john s long suffering secretary stonewall sidles by with another cutting comment or clever observation. since the film, in the end, belongs to hayworth, neither kelly nor arden can save it as a whole. this isn t to say that the film is bad it isn t. it s enjoyable, with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to look at. but it s just not quite a classic. the dancing is classic though so watch cover girl for that, and you won t regret it.\n",

            "Review: though the title includes the word zombies , this film is not what you d expect from a movie made today, though for the concept is played out about as well as would probably be expected. dean jagger portrays armand louque, an officer in the french army of world war i, who has stumbled upon an ancient tale of soldiers turned into automatons, or zombies , who are impervious in battle and may hold the key to victory in the war, though on whose side is not certain. at first he has trouble convincing his superiors of this phenomenon, but eventually french general duval george cleveland orders a non military expedition into the ancient cambodian city of angkor to find the secret of the zombies and destroy it. br br the story is played out against the backdrop of a love triangle involving louque, duval s daughter claire dorothy stone , and clifford grayson robert noland , all a part of the expedition. when louque laments over his lack of forcefulness and resolve, grayson offers him advice to go after what he wants in life with all his power. that advice begins to transform louque, particularly after he s successful in obtaining a stone tablet resembling a photo from the ancient city. having followed a temple priest into a swamp, louque now appears to hold the secret he had been seeking, though it s not made clear how he has instantaneously been able to command the power of zombiefication . all it takes is placing his right fist to the forehead simulating a third eye, and casting his thoughts out to those he wishes to control. this comes in handy for winning back his girl, and taking grayson s early advice as he comments to his servant, buna, we re learning to be ruthless . br br fans of early b horror flicks will recognize the use of bela lugosi s signature eye stare, plucked from the film white zombie , also from director victor halperin. of the two movies, white zombie is preferably superior, both in story content and in it s depiction of the undead, where the zombies have a more sinister appearance and are more threatening. in revolt , the zombies are enemy soldiers with a glazed over look that merely react to their mentor s commands. in fact, the actual revolt of the title occurs only when louque releases the soldiers from his mental command in deference to his love for claire they overrun his compound and kill him in the process. br br not to be too harsh on the film, it plays out decently within the parameters of it s story outline, but if you re thinking zombies within the traditional context, you ll probably be disappointed. if you want to sample an early treatment of the subject, the aforementioned white zombie with bela lugosi is the way to go.\n",

            "Review: to most of us, life is an unfolding process of love. for others like soo mi, however, it is dominated by darkness and fear. based on the korean folk tale jangha and hongryun, kim ji woon s brilliant gothic horror story a tale of two sisters revolves around two sisters, soo mi lim su jeong , and soo yeon mun geon yeong , who are part of a dysfunctional family that live together in a creepy victorian style mansion. feeling alienated from the world, they cling to each other for survival with the older soo mi obsessively protecting the younger soo yeon against danger. for soo mi, however, not coming to terms with the circumstances surrounding her mother s death means mental illness and a mind at odds with reality. br br while we may recognize staples such as haunted houses with apparitional sightings, doors that open and close on their own, a cruel and overbearing stepmother, and other events of high strangeness, a tale of two sisters superbly explores deeper psychological meanings including the inability to let go of inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge. soo mi says do you know what s really scary you want to forget something. totally wipe it off your mind. but you never can. it can t go away, you see. and... and it follows you around like a ghost. there is a time line but it is left for the viewer to unravel. the plot cannot be summarized, only suggested and the film keeps us wondering whether what is happening on screen is objective or subjective. br br in the film s opening, soo mi, an obviously disturbed young woman, is being questioned by a doctor in a setting that looks like a mental institution. when the doctor asks her to describe what happened that day , the film flashes back to when soo mi and soo yeon return to the home of their father moo hyeon kim kap su and stepmother eun joo yum jung ah . the stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant but it is obvious that it is soo mi who is really hurting. as the girls try to readjust, they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house, which may be nightmares or supernatural occurrences. br br soo mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed that hovers over her and oozes black blood, a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and goes into convulsions, a monster emerges from between the legs of one of the sisters, people mysteriously disappear from photographs, and many other maniacal schizophrenic devices to keep the viewer dangling on the edge of insanity. while we sense that much of the story is the projection of someone s mind, we do not know whose and the film keeps us constantly challenged, at least until an important clue is offered in the film s second half. br br shot in gorgeous low light cinematography, a tale of two sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that transcends all the scares, and there are plenty. it is haunting in more than one sense of the word and its images may stare back at you when you least expect or want them to. while the film may not offer the weary traveler much in the way of light, it shows us where we can end up if we opt for the darkness. in the words of a wise observer, blame is never the answer whether it is blaming yourself or others. rather, the answer lies in stepping out of judgment entirely both of yourself and others. forgiveness and understanding have great power of healing. \n",

            "Review: revolt of the zombies is bad. there is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie. it is dull, lifeless, poorly acted, and poorly scripted. i ve often complained that the original dracula is a little slow for my taste, well this movie makes dracula look like a roller coaster ride. the minute running time seemed like minutes. br br the story an expedition is sent to cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through zombification . one man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him. once this happens, he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences. that s it. that s the whole story. br br for most of the movie, i was trying to figure out where i had seen the male lead. he looked so familiar. i had plenty of time to think this over. nothing was happening in the movie. just before the zombies revolted , it hit me. it was dean jagger. i had seen him recently as the general in white christmas. this is how i entertained myself throughout most of the movie. br br i m just glad i didn t buy the dvd for this movie. king of the zombies is on the other side and it s a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie. for what it s worth, i ll give it a . i won t go to because, believe it or not, i ve seen worse. \n",

            "Review: as was to be expected, a mazursky film made in the s would be counter culture, sympathetic towards the hippies and have a lot of hippies in it and, naturally, it is childishly anti authoritarian e.g. the scene on the mexican border, when sutherland provokes a custom s officer by showing little respect and then accuses the latter of making him open his luggage only because he sutherland has long hair . the constant left wing dribble could have gotten on my nerves had i not been prepared for it beforehand sutherland muses aloud to his family and friends about potential movie ideas for his next film, and most of these ideas are either about blacks or indians needless to say, he would be welcomed with open arms in today s hollywood . one of his movie ideas is about a black uprising in beverly hills a race war, so to speak, in the middle of l.a.. this is the kind of nonsense that mazursky thinks about when writing scripts for his movies. fortunately, some of sutherland s hippie friends make fun of this black revolution premise, and the resulting dialogue isn t bad a little later, the jewish guy makes a crack about sutherland making a movie about masturbation and the black problem , when the latter starts talking about masturbation. another funny moment is when sutherland s older daughter performs some pc crap on stage with her white school mates, and they all say we, the black people of the republic of south africa... . br br there is always a certain amount of self indulgence when hollywood makes a movie about hollywood especially when it s hollywood making a movie about hollywood discussing hollywood doing movies. now, that s very, very self indulgent, indeed. the scene with fellini playing himself is more amusing than annoying, though. mazursky throws in the standard flower children and anti vietnam bullshit into the soup, and also pokes fun at corporate hollywood, but he was is just as much a part of the phony hollywood lyrics from that song in the surreal war segment as anyone else i am pretty sure that he, too, makes phony small talk in beverly hills parties and grins fakely while shaking the hands of people whom he either doesn t know or like, but whose money he wants badly for his next left wing project. as for his hair he has the worst hair i ve seen in a very long time on film or elsewhere it s sort of like the kind of long hair that a middle aged accountant would have if he grew it long. the film remains relatively interesting in spite of its aimlessness, but it bogs down somewhat into tedium in the last third. if you d like to read my parody biography of donald sutherland and other hollywood actors , contact me by e mail.\n",

            "Review: lackawanna blues is a fine stage play by ruben santiago hudson and an even finer film as the author adapted his own life story for the screen. this brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors, fine music, brilliant editing, superb direction by george c. wolfe, and a cast so stunning that they make an encore viewing compulsory yes, it is just that good. br br the story is based on the author s life as the child junior marcus carl franklin raised in the inimitable home of soulfully empathetic rachel nanny crosby s. epatha merkerson , a lady who devoted her life to aiding the disenfranchised by transporting them from the south, from mental hospitals, and from the streets to lackawanna, new york. the boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house odd characters with painful pasts and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by nanny. the myriad characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business terrence howard, rosie perez, mos def, the beautiful carmen ejogo, louis gossett jr., jeffrey wright, ernie hudson, charlayne woodward, jimmy smits, patricia wettig, macy gray, liev schreiber, kathleen chalfant, lou myers, hill harper the list goes on and on. br br in the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the infectious joy of african american music contributions to our musical culture, and the courage of one fine woman who battled all the hardships the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact. s. epatha merkerson is wholly submerged in this role, a role she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos. she offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years, and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an hbo movie, she without a doubt would add the oscar to place along side her golden globe award. br br the entire cast is exceptional and wolfe handles the acting and the story like a master like riffs in a jazz piece, he pastes tiny moments of conversation with each character and junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues, jazz, dancing, and joy. the production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention lag from the momentum of the story. highly recommended, almost compulsory viewing grady harp\n",

adamant, committed to whatever it is and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it. but we re all different, made of different clay, as one of the characters in this film puts it, which is what makes life so interesting. some people are just plain crazy, though and maybe that s the way you have to be to live among the masses. who knows who knows what it takes to make things life work writer director lisa krueger takes a shot at it, using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed and how one gets committed and obsession, in committed, starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy, too. her name is joline, and this is her story. br br . admittedly, joline has always been a committed person in work, relationships, in life in general. she s a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what. and when she marries carl luke wilson , it s forever. the only problem is, someone forgot to tell carl and days into the marriage, he s gone off to find himself and figure it all out. when joline realizes he s not coming back, she refuses to give up on him, or their marriage. maybe it s because of that clay she s made of. regardless, she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him, which she does in el paso, texas, of all places. but once she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, giving him his space and not even letting him know she s there. she considers carl as being in a spiritual coma, and it s her job to keep a spiritual vigil over him until he comes to his senses. and while she watches and waits, her life is anything but dull, as she encounters a young woman named carmen patricia velazquez , a waitress at one of the local eateries carmen s grampy, alfonso arau , who is something of a mystic t bo mark ruffalo , a truck driver who has issues concerning carl and neil goran visnjic an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her. for joline, it s a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about carl, but even more about herself. br br . there s a touch of humor, a touch of romance, and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot. and krueger presents it all extremely well, delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining. her characters are very real people, with all the wants, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story. we see it from joline s point of view, as krueger makes us privy to joline s thoughts and therefore her motivations, which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold. that, along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates, makes for a very effective piece of storytelling. there s an underlying seriousness to this subject matter, but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters. and the result is a well textured, affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life. br br . heather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation. she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable, adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person, and one that is real. and for this film to work, it was imperative that joline be viable and believable and graham succeeds on all fronts. her screen presence has never been more alluring, and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes, is enough to draw you in entirely. it s all a part of the character she creates there s an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance, who she is inside and out. she s a likable, agreeable person, and because you ve shared her innermost thoughts, you know who she is. it s a good job all the way around, beginning with the way the character was written, to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life. br br . as carmen, patricia velazquez is totally engaging, as well. her performance is very natural and straightforward, and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character. she has a charismatic presence, but is less than flamboyant, and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down to earth. she is refreshingly open and up front you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back, but is totally honest on all fronts, and that, too, is part of her appeal. and, as with joline, this character is well written, and velazquez brings her convincingly to life. br br . overall, there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including those of luke wilson, casey affleck as joline s brother, jay , goran visnjic, alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as t bo, who, with very little actual screen time, manages to create a memorable character. br br . the supporting cast includes kim dickens jenny , clea du vall mimi , summer phoenix meg , art alexakis new york car thief , dylan baker carl s editor , and mary kay place psychiatrist . a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture reflecting upon who we are, where we re going and what we really need committed is an enjoyable experience a ride definitely worth taking. .\n",

            "Review: there are so many more complexities to the plot of this wonderful thought provoking movie than just infidelity and cover up of responsibility for the accident. i was struck by the initial seeming goodness of husband wilkinson who wanted the driver, when he thought it was everett, disclosed to the police, and the change of heart and morals when he learned it was his wife. as well, was he indeed good, and or was he attempting to redeem self by allowing her to go with rupert. then, things switchedand she decided the right ting to do was admit that she hit him. most importantly the theme of redemption for the accident for the infidelity in her own odd, flawed way is strongest in watson s sickbed care for everett. i believe that is why she undertook that effort. br br this seems to be a common theme in modern british novels brideshead revisited, the end of the affair come to mind. love it.\n",

            "Review: i m not a big fan of most anime, but gundam wing is truly something else. gundam wing lacks all of that stereotypical melodrama that you might think of when you think of anime, since the number of jokes made over the hours would only be in the double digits, gundam wing gets right down to business. br br gundam wing is as much of a political thriller as it is an action series. large parts focus on the diplomatic dealings of a war, not only the battles. though battle animation lacks extreme detail in cases where it would just be a pain to animate, individual duels between gundams are almost pieces of art considering the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid movements. br br to my knowledge, this episode plus one movie series was picked up by cartoon network in , and then professionally dubbed by them too. the dubbing is simply flawless. not only does every word said match up, but the voices use truly make the characters much more believable. many believe that it is best to watch anime with subs in english, but i simply don t have the determination to do that. br br not only are the voices good, but the score used over the series is quite impressive. i ll just say it left me scouring the net in vain to find a soundtrack. br br the plot of this series is what will truly hook viewers, and no, not hook you like some prime time drama like lost which was only made for the purpose of hooking you. explaining the plot deeply would lead to many spoilers, since many of the characters do not even have names until quite a few episodes into the series. the rough idea of the series is that earth and its now independent space colonies are having difficulty maintaining peace. thus a war is started, leading to military coups and elaborate diplomatic situations. i feel that any more detail would begin to give away information, which is crucial to the plot. br br i ll end here saying that this series is great for anyone that likes anime, anyone that thinks all anime is stupid they have good reason to think so , and anyone looking to get into anime with a serious tone to it.\n",

            "Review: during the brief period between clint eastwood s string of spaghetti westerns and his dirty harry films, he and director don siegel teamed up to make this unusual picture. eastwood plays an injured union army corporal during the civil war who is taken in by a southern school for girls until he recovers from his wounds. it has been a while since the young women most of which seem to be teenagers have had a man on the premises, so they are reluctant to turn him in to the local rebel soldiers. the resulting situations are often humorous, shocking, erotic, or even downright grotesque as eastwood slowly regains his strength and begins to brood over the establishment. br br the basic storyline almost sounds like the makings of a porno film. we have a masculine male suddenly surrounded by young nubile women. most of them are sexually attracted to him. and he is more than willing to spread the love amongst them. the material never really slips down to the level of tasteless , however. eastwood, siegel, and cinematographer bruce surtees are such skilled filmmakers, that the film always retains its dignity. br br eastwood s john mcburney is like no other character he has ever played. mcburney is an amoral, conniving, and lustful charlatan. he knows that most of the women, even the youngest want his bod, and he lets more than one of them have a shot at him. mcburney often uses flattery to butter the women up, then uses his rugged good looks to reel them in. he is like a drunken player at a cocktail party, often hitting on different women even in the same scene eventually, his lustful ways cause him great agony and loss in a way you must see for yourselves. this author would not dream of revealing the specific consequences of his actions, but there is little doubt he has them coming. br br eastwood gives a typically great performance. he seems to be having a blast with the role until things turn really ugly, then he turns mean and ugly. geraldine page is a treat as the steely b tch who runs the school. we know she wants mcburney as much as the other girls, but with her checkered past shown to us in flashbacks, we find out that isn t all she s after mae mercer as a slave belonging to the school gives a great performance, too. she obviously knows mcburney is a skunk from the beginning, and she never lets his phony charm bring her guard down. this is a character you will want to know more about after the film is over. she seems to have a greater knowledge of the world than anyone else in the film. br br the beguiled did poorly in its theatrical release. nobody was quite sure what to make of it, and some of its content no doubt raised a few eyebrows in . for example, in an early scene we see eastwood romantically kiss a yr old girl. is he just trying to keep her quiet when the rebel soldiers get close, or is he really enjoying it probably both a fantasy sequence later on even shows clint getting it on with not only page, but her young assistant truly some interesting goings on in this one. it s a good thing eastwood became the star he did, or this one might have been long forgotten. br br highly recommended. of stars. br br the hound.\n",

            "Review: choose your fate the terrible tykes of the fourth form, playing practical jokes that involve axes, or the...ummm...well developed girls of the sixth form, who discovered some time ago cigarettes, gin, sex and how easily men can be led astray. the problem is that one set comes with the other. they are all there at st. trinian s, that remarkably easy going english school for girls led by headmistress millicent fritton alastair sim . as miss fritton is fond of pointing out, in other schools girls are sent out quite unprepared into a merciless world, but when our girls leave here, it is the merciless world which has to be prepared. miss fritton sounds something like a melding of julia child and eleanor roosevelt, and definitely has sim s droll and deadpan comic genes. br br in the belles of st. trinian s, a sly, chaotic comedy from the team of frank launder and sidney gilliat, st. trinian s is, as usual, on the brink of financial disaster. salvation may be at hand, however, when a rich sheik sends his daughter to join the fourth form and receive a proper english education. the sheik also is a horse owner and one of his prize racers, arab boy, is being trained near the school for a race. it s only a matter of time before the fourth form girls form a racing pool and bet heavily on arab boy, with miss fritton adding to the pool what funds the school has left. much of the fourth form girl s money comes from the gin they make in chemistry, then bottle and lower by rope to flash harry george cole , a cockney fixer, for distribution. it s got something...i don t know quite what, says miss fritton on sampling the stuff, but send a few bottles up to my room. br br miss fritton, however, has a brother, clarence fritton who, by some coincidence of casting, also is alastair sim , a bookmaker who not only has placed a bundle on another horse, but who also has a daughter. and he has placed the precocious arabella in the sixth form to keep him informed. soon the sixth form has kidnapped arab boy, the fourth form has taken the horse back, flash harry has joined forces with miss fritton, the sixth form girls are determined that arab boy will not leave the second floor of st. trinian s, clarence and his homburg wearing gang have arrived, parents are driving up for parent s day and the ministry of education has arrived in the person of a very proper inspector. total war breaks out at st. trinian s. it s hard to say which is more dangerous, the african spears or the flour bombs. br br alastair sim as millicent fritton turns in a tour de force performance. miss fritton is a tall woman with a stately bosom, fond of long gowns with embroidered lace and edwardian hats with lots of feathers. she takes everything in stride, even a fourth former pounding at something in chemistry class and, after hearing an explosion a few minutes later, the results. oh dear. i told bessie to be careful with that nitro glycerine she is firm in believing that st. trinian s is a gay arcadia of happy girls. sim was one of britain s great eccentric actors. other than the sheer chaos of all the little and not so little girls doing terrible things, he delivers much of the film s pleasure.\n",

            "Review: a very early oliver stone associate produced film, and one of the first films in the impressive career of lloyd kaufman co founder and president of the world s only real independent film studio troma, creator of the toxic avenger and, at the prestigious amsterdam fantastic filmfestival, lifetime achievement awarded filmmaker for over years . having raised the money for this film on his own, lloyd wrote this script together with theodore gershuni in and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself. but back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore. indeed it would have been interesting to see lloyd s version of his own script as one of the world s most original, daring, experimental and non compromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has. but as it is we have the gershuni directed film. and weather it is due to the strong script, or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own, sugar cookies is a very intelligent, highly suspenseful and well crafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives. the shoestring budget the small studio this was even before kaufman and his friend and partner for over years now, michael herz, formed troma had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive, indeed does not have a low budget look at all. the story revolves around lesbian camilla stone played by enigmatic mary woronow and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances i won t reveal not to spoil a delightful story. this leads to a succession of plot twists, mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by hitchcock s vertigo and at least as inventive. the atmosphere is a lot grimmer, though, and some comparisons to nicholas roeg s and donald cammell s performance come to mind. in this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end, which, along with a splendidly interwoven sub plot with a nod to kaufman s earlier and unfortunately unavailable big guss what s the fuss, makes for a very exciting one and a half hour. certainly one of the best films in troma s library, and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste. the dvd includes some recent interviews kaufman conducts with woronov and the other leading lady lynn lowry later seen in george romero s the crazies , thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cult favorite and a few hints of what would be different had lloyd directed it himself. highly recommended.\n",

            "Review: i remember seeing the very first trailer for underdog back last march, i also remember at the time smiling to myself ever so slightly. sure it was a cheesy idea, but i genuinely thought at the time the concept might work, hell it couldn t be any worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could it then by december and i suddenly remembered the film i realised how likely the film was to suck, the fact it had been delayed in the uk made it seem inevitable it would be terrible, but the horrendous reviews just made me realise it was nigh on impossible for the movie to be any good. still i swallowed my feelings and went to see the film with a friend today, as i entered my screen i was mortified, it was the very first time i d be seeing a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen little did i know for what i was about to endure. underdog to put it blunt is horrendous, it really is. imagine how bad you could think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse, that is just how pathetic the movie is. while it aims to entertain kids it just seems an embarrassing mess that seems to insult kids rather than allow them to enjoy the movie. matters cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond lacklustre, the acting is generally poor, and the movie just feels like an over long, tired and downright boring saturday cartoon after a brief five minutes where i thought the movie might be passable the movie just suddenly seems to die and then limp on towards the already sign posted finale. i m just amazed the movie was actually ever released, it s an embarrassment to disney, hell half their straight to video sequels are better than this what s even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel br br so lets get onto the acting cracks knuckles . okay let me be honest jason lee is decent, his voice suits the canine, and had he have been given a decent script he might have made the performance work. however, with such a dodgy script he just seems to flounder. in many ways it reminded me of bill murray in garfield, murray did what he could with what he had, but what he had wasn t enough to make it passable. then we get onto the human actors, and well the majority of atrocious. alex neuberger plays the friend of underdog, jack. my biggest concern is that anybody would even take him seriously in an audition. the scene where he gets to fly with underdog is perhaps the most cringe worthy scene in the past few years just because his acting is so poor. not once did i believe he was a real person, in fact part of me is still convinced he was a robot made specially for the movie james belushi seems half dead in the film, he has nothing to work with, no decent lines, he just seems to wander around the set waiting to become relevant to the plot, which the writers try to do towards the end but do it in such a poor way its laughable. thankfully peter dinklage is the one redeeming factor of the movie, he is great as dr barsinister and seems to be having a laugh in the role. he steals every scene he is in, although that s hardly difficult when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying patrick warburton. the rest of the cast are even worse, especially taylor momsen, she just needs to end her acting career right now br br underdog also fails dramatically in terms of delivering anything like a funny scene. when the funniest scene involves underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere you know there is something drastically wrong. this could be easily ignored if the movie had decent action or a good story, alas the movie is even worse in both of these terms. the effects are so ropey that any scene where underdog flies just seems absurd, and the dog uses his powers to such little effect that you frequently forget he has superpowers. what s the point in making a film about a super dog if the damned dog never appears super the final fight also verges on embarrassing purely because its ten minutes of nothingness, the dog flies, other stuff happens, some stuff gets chucked about, all of this is irrelevant as this stuff is happening for the sake of stuff happening. the script as well is dodgy at best and downright pain inducingly awful at worst. when someone says look its a plane, no its a bird, no its a frog... , yes you read that right, i just wanted to burst into tears there and then. actually i wanted to walk out by remained compelled to see whether it could get any lower than that point, this happens near the end so it doesn t thankfully. br br overall underdog becomes the worst movie of at this early period, and is actually just as bad as last years epic movie. luckily for underdog, meet the spartans arrives over here soon and i expect that to be even worse. so in case you didn t get the point of my review, avoid the film at all costs, if you want to see a movie with a dog then watch cats and dogs, buy a real dog if necessary, just do not see this \n",

            "Review: oh, my goodness. i would have never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than domestic disturbance this soon, but here it is. armed with rotten plot, terrible editing, stilted acting, and headache inducing style sorry, i have no other words for it , sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to re evaluate an entire genre that is, this film is so bad that even the thrillers i condemned as complete failures now seem a little better. br br now, not only sanctimony is a terrible film in itself, it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movies and do a pathetic job with it. right from the main titles nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the ones from se en i was under the impression that something didn t smell quite right. as soon as the movie started with a series of corny, wanna be hip quick cuts full of gory images and bombastic colors, i knew where that smell was coming from. br br it turns out that two policemen, or rather policeman jim renart michael and policewoman dorothy smith jennifer rubin , are investigating on a murder spree in vancouver. a serial killer, known as monkey killer what a menacing, chilling nickname, uh for his working methods, has killed quite a lot of people. you see, this nut apparently works following the proverb see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil and cuts eyes, ears, and tongues out of his victims. so far, six eyes, six ears, and three tongues. in very ingenious fashion, renart and smith figure out that the monkey killer is probably going to kill other three people... well, because he probably wants to complete the number . so suddenly the film focuses on tom gerrick casper van dien , a young, successful, good looking businessman, with a dreadful temper. and that s where the rip off of american psycho kicks in. br br so we follow the life of the two police officers and the young psychopath, none of which is interesting in the least, until they finally meet. along the way to that, a disco where renart barely misses gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory renart goes in the back of the disco club, because... well, just because the script tells us it s a suspect place then, with one single punch in the stomach, renard gets rid of a big guard who blocks the path, and the guard is never heard of again does this scene strike anyone else as completely unrealistic br br anyway, after another murder, gerrick turns in as a witness, but smith and especially renart immediately suspect he might be the killer. in typical basic instinct fashion, smith gets some dates with the young businessman, under the assumption that she might discover his true identity. br br i won t spoil the ending but it is, quite simply, an embarrassment there are contradictions, some plot holes, issues that never get resolved, and especially there is one last scene where a brutal mass murder, supposed to be shocking and sad, comes off as such laughably overdone and nonsensical that i frankly can t imagine how anyone could not laugh at it. br br at minutes, sanctimony is really pushing it. you never care about one single character, because they are all so flat not to mention boring that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them. you are never pulled into the story, because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when not downright unnecessary and out of place. the acting ranges from average van dien to downright atrocious rubin, and most of the supporting cast the music is abysmal generic techno, and the photography is one of the worst i have ever seen. of course, like every fiasco of the genre, we are provided with a little bit of gratuitous nudity. br br \n",

            "Review: when john singleton is on, he s on and this is one of his better films. not quite as tight as boyz n the hood, but close to it and with much of the same stellar cast . this film was very well written, very well put together, and very well shot. there s very little to criticize, and most of my complaints are superficial eg where did fudge get the money for years of college and a lot of expensive stuff no mention of a rich background... and why doesn t professor phibbs have an office a professor of his stature should have one... and while we re at it, for an engineering student, hick or not, remy s a pretty dumb character i d think that he d have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence he talks and acts like a total buffoon . br br but that aside, the film was very sharp. a good array of characters and points of view and singleton doesn t take sides in the story many of the characters are unsympathetic, and he does a good job of interspersing the panthers and supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sides. br br much of the cinematography was excellent i especially loved the scene where kirsty swanson gets intimate with taryn and wayne each scene spliced together really well. also the malik deja scenes were really well shot as well. br br the dialogue was a bit much at times this film had a tendency to get really preachy at times, and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the bluntness we really didn t need the us flag with unlearn typed onto it, give some credit, we re not morons... . and to top it off, although most of the time singleton uses melodrama quite well, sometimes it gets way too cheezy like deja s death, which is fine until she screams out why which simply ruined the entire effect and scene . br br but the acting, in general, was top of the line. fabulous performances by omar epps perhaps the best i ve ever seen , kirsty swanson who knew buffy could act , michael rapaport surprised the hell out of me...after true romance and beautiful girls i though he was a one role actor , and of course ice cube and laurence fishburne are always outstanding. br br downside jennifer connelly was flat though it s not completely her fault her role was stereotypical and one dimensional. generic to the highest degree. and tyra banks, who had the role, was nothing short of horrid. she whined and whined and whined. yet another in the long line of models turned actresses who failed miserably though there are a few who prove the exception to this rule . br br finally, the soundtrack wow an amazing soundtrack which is definitely worth buying which fits the film like a glove. each scene has a twin song although the tori amos songs started to really annoy me by the end...not her best work . liz phair, rage against the machine, ice cube...how can one go wrong br br all in all a really good watch, a really strong cast, great script, great film. .\n",

            "Review: this is the best direct to dvd effort from van damme that i have seen yet. van damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the united states. the action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with van damme s best. costar scott adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. for further evidence check out undisputed . adkins is so good in fact that before i watched the shepherd , i thought that van damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen. van damme holds his own though and although he isn t quite as athletic as adkins is, he can still kick with the best of them. all of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well. the only negative thing i can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped. i think van damme s character s motives should have been presented earlier in the movie, especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit. the reason he does is very cool but you don t find out until the very end. there are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a van damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it ain t character development. overall though, this is a solid action movie that i recommend. so run for the damme border \n",

            "Review: i wish i knew what to make of a movie like this. it seems to be divided into two parts action sequences and personal dramas ashore. it follows ashton kutsher through survival swimmer school, guided by master chief kevin costner, then to alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place, the last resulting in death. br br i must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotypical in so many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted. a typical bar room fight between navy guys and coast guardsmen puddle pirates . the experienced old timer costner who is, as an elderly bar tender tells him, married to the coast guard. the older chief who keeps trying to prove to himself that he s still nineteen. the neglected ex wife ashore to whom kostner pays a farewell visit. the seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors, all in pursuit of a loftier goal. the gifted young man hobbled by a troubled past. br br the problem is that we ve seen it all before. if it s kevin costner here, it s clint eastwood or john wayne or lou gosset jr. or vigo mortenson or robert deniro elsewhere. and the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from the perfect storm and dead calm. none of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originality. br br it works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the swimmer s school and what could happen afterward and even that s a little weak because we don t get much in the way of instruction. it s mostly personal conflict, romance, and tension about washing out. br br it s a shame because the u. s. coast guard is rather a noble outfit, its official mission being the safety of lives and property at sea. in war time it is transferred to the navy department and serves in combat roles. in world war ii, the coast guard even managed to have a medal of honor winner in its ranks. br br but, again, we don t learn much about that. we don t really learn much about anything. the film devolves into a succession of visual displays and not too much else. a disappointment.\n",

            "Review: i should have trusted my instincts better no expectations no disappointments. instead, however, i expected to experience a similar masterpiece like koyaanisqatsi and was brutally disappointed. powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor, and artistically it fails miserably. it appears some producer gathered up leftover material from koyaanisqatsi, hurriedly threw it together, placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of philip glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music, which is incessantly repeated. where koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow motion if you view them on your vcr in fast preview mode, you ll see what i mean . what disappointed me the most, however, was philip glass s soundtrack. i couldn t and still can t believe that these commercial sounding new age type drones, which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any year old on a casio calculator, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly synchronized music for koyaanisqatsi. all in all, a big waste of time my advice forget commercialism watch koyaanisqatsi again instead \n",

            "Review: i was recently given this film on dvd as a gift, and was unsure at first if it would appeal although one of my favourite actors has a leading role . in fact, it s on its way to becoming a favourite. br br first of all thankfully, it s not the same as the book, the ending of which i think is excessively melodramatic. secondly it s one of the best films i ve seen about the first world war. what you may ask. it s not a war film true we see no battles or bombardments, no trenches, no gas. but it shows the cost of war, the damage done to the lives of the men who fought in it, and the impact this had on those close to them. br br we first see helen sarah miles , a baronet s widow, awaiting her release from a mental hospital. all the women in the film appear to be widows some from the war, but helen s much older husband, sir thomas we see him later in a photograph was taken ill and died while she was at a party, hence her guilt stricken breakdown. she is lost and lonely. the wire around the hospital grounds evokes pow camps and the trenches like many of the men in the outside world, helen is suffering from a kind of shell shock. br br out of hospital, she has to find her feet in the outside world again a world we experience through her eyes as bleak, desolate and unfriendly. her mother is unable to provide her with any real support. herself a widow, she has put up her own emotional defences, behind which she hides to avoid dealing with her daughter s distress. like many people, especially in that time, she seems to find mental illness embarrassing. br br ledbetter, the hired driver, becomes a supportive presence, and helps helen begin to adjust to life again, but she does not realise that he is becoming dangerously obsessed with her. this is a superb performance by robert shaw. ledbetter is a former regular soldier, an ex sergeant major who runs a boxing club and has set up his own car hire business. superficially, he seems tough and strong, dependable, but there are cracks beneath the surface he has not really adjusted to civilian life. he invents for reasons he later explains a family and home life he does not have he has brutal outbursts with colleagues, and affection less sex. getting close to helen a woman whom, even with the greater post war social freedom, he could not realistically have hoped to marry exposes psychological fault lines that tear him apart. these days, one might diagnose ptsd. br br the same is true of the other man in helen s life, aspiring politician captain hugh cantrip peter egan . he is ambitious, handsome, but also very young. tellingly, his girlfriend, connie caroline mortimer , mothers him, combing his hair and making sure he has a clean handkerchief before he goes out. he is known to both ledbetter and helen the former had served under him during the war, and helen had met him in political circles and had thought him a popinjay . however, he and helen now begin a relationship, with helen intending to support his political career, financially and emotionally. peter egan, fresh from his stage success as stanhope in r c sheriff s journey s end , makes hugh more than an immature cad. there is a revealing, understated scene in the back of the car between helen and hugh, in which they quote brooke s the old vicarage at grantchester . she asks, of his war experience, was it very bad he cannot answer. she says well, you re back now. but his softly spoken reply am i sometimes i wonder is the key to his character. as light and shadow flicker across his face, we know that there are some horrors that cannot be put into words. the disproportionate casualties suffered by junior officers of his sort straight out of school or university and expected to lead from the front are well known. in a nervous speech during which helen reassures him to local political folk at a dinner party, he reveals that he will stand as an independent, no longer as a liberal the party which had taken the country into the war . his emotional life is as damaged as ledbetter s. he cannot easily extricate himself from connie, who depends on him emotionally and financially reading between the lines, she is probably a war widow perhaps of a former comrade with a child, whose drawings we see on the wall of her home. br br spoilers br br the crisis between the trio builds slowly, with a frightening scene between helen and ledbetter in the car, and ledbetter listening in to hugh and connie when he is driving them, as hugh tries to persuade connie that, even as his relationship with helen develops, they can continue theirs that he will, at least, continue to support her. jealousy, obsession and his belief that he must protect helen from a duplicitous gold digger lead ledbetter to confront her and hugh violently in her home. br br the ending is entirely different from that of the novel, and is better for it it is dramatic, but less melodramatic, and maintains an unsentimental tone. we began with one character recovering from a mental breakdown we end with another suffering one. helen, one senses, is now wiser and stronger than both the men, who have been unable fully to adapt to the so called land fit for heroes to which they returned from the nightmare of total war. the new ending is open one feels that she, at least, will cope with whatever lies ahead, without illusions. in this, it reflects well the reality of the time, in which women helen, connie, and so many others had to pick up the pieces of a world in which too many men had died or had come home with varying degrees of mental and physical damage. br br well, you re back now. am i sometimes i wonder \n",

            "Review: hoot is about these three teenage kids who try to save a bunch of burrowing owls. now to me i thinks that right they stand up to whats right and whats wrong. in this film a kid name roy eberhardt logan lerman moved from montana to florida. and once he gets on the bus a bully name dana matherson starts bullying him finally the next day roy punches the bully and runs off the bus chasing the mysterious running boy. after all that roy finally meets the running boy who s name is mullet fingers cody linley well actually his nickname his step sister beatrice brie larson gave it to him because he can catch mullets with his bare hands. anyway mullet fingers and roy becomes friends and they join together with beatrice to stop the construction of a new pancake restaurant. mullet fingers is the one behind all the vandalism s that happened there and also later he gets bit by one of the dogs that put there to guard the construction site. so they stood up to the muckle that was driving the bulldozer and everybody got to see the owls it turned out to be a great movie because it showed where kids can make a difference in life by standing up to whats right and whats wrong. thats what is great about this movie. it teaches a lot to everyone about wildlife and how important it is.\n",

            "Review: mas oyama was the most successful karate master of the late th century. he rejected the training of the karate clubs of the time focusing on an intense no holds form of training. he eventually built his system into a huge business empire with hundreds of schools across the world, without compromising his teachings. the testing in the kyokushin schools are still some of the most physically challenging tests any martial art school requires. one non physical hardship oyama faced was prejudice due to his korean ancestry and he spent time proving that loyalties were to japan and japanese karate. this movie series was part of that effort although anyone who had the chance to meet oyama i did would never question his allegiance to japan. in this series, oyama s most famous student, sonny chiba, is called upon to portray his master. br br oyama arrives from the countryside where he has been training alone. he challenges and makes short work of the established karate schools he encounters. disgusted by the state of karate, oyama returns to his lone training. he eventually picks up a student, falls in love and gets in the way of gangsters who are allied with the established karate schools. in the middle of this is the legendary bullfight with a mad bull. how much of the film is true is questionable. br br that oyama could kill a bull with his bare hands is true. he was called on to repeat this feat numerous times. there are filmed instances of oyama actually doing this, although sometimes the bulls seemed to be tethered as oyama was getting on in years. sonny chiba portrays his master with conviction and the karate is quite good. chiba may not have been the best karate practitioner but, at this point in time, he was certainly above average. br br as a whole the movie is good, much better then most martial art films in the drama department. i always wondered why it s not more well known. possibly it the very realistic depictions of martial arts. people are shown getting tired and hurt unlike of action film where the hero is a limitless fountain of energy and each blow instantly dispatches an opponent to death. chiba seems so exhausted at one point that it hurts to watch. perhaps viewers rather not have their entertainment reflect reality so closely. br br recommended especially for martial artists.\n",

            "Review: philippe garrel makes us breathe the forgotten atmosphere of the nouvelle vague, almost lost among the vestiges of its ancient splendor but ready to rise again from its ashes if recalled from the past. they who are a little acquainted with the director s subjects, on the other hand, may know very well how he s obsessed by a lingering sense of loss as far as fickleness of reality is concerned. les amants therefore, show us the parallel stories of an amour fou and of a tempted revolution gone to ruin under the direction of young french students. br br the first part of the story is about the dramatic events of may in france evoked in a series of astonishing plan sequences, a sort of cinema style, that place the student insurrection in anything but an enviable light against a pitch black background. br br there s much that can be said about the peculiarities of black and white photography used to describe the battle between students and police, where the high contrasts confer an unrealistic atmosphere to the sequences and darkness closes in upon the excited bodies wrapping them in mystery. the images, completely deprived of words, show the real consistence of the myth, made of crude violence, more and more emphasized by the exasperated reality of the movie shootings. the individual doesn t count anything at all here he tends to disappear in the mass. what really matters in these fight scenes are the significance of the mass suggestion, the blind fury of the juvenile assault, sinister eulogies of the power of the mob, even if conceived like separate entities apart from any kind of emotion, with the cold and distant look of an entomologist intent to catalog his insect collection. br br the second part of the story is described in a quieter and most intimate way. stands out on the horizon the distressing portrait of a self centered generation in search of its lost time, completely disenchanted about the individual values of men, inclined to rotate on its own axis between opium fumes and making a funeral oration in the praise of its recent defeat. br br les amants seems to evoke from time to time the shadow of the great robert bresson, revised and corrected by garrel s particular sensibility without drifting away from the main argument, trying to expand overall perspectives on the subject of human disillusions that though painful may bring us to the truth. in my opinion, trying to penetrate deeply into the substrate of the story, if a man lets himself go and play things by ear, he probably will find that he can bring out the dark side of his self with dire and irretrievable consequences.\n",

            "Review: it should come as no shock to you when i say that alone in the dark is a crappy movie. to put it bluntly, it s as if a dung monster defecated, ate the result, and then vomited. the final product would still outshine this movie. br br seemingly based on an ancient atari video game, the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth, the unleashing of demons, and ancient civilizations. something about there being two worlds, that of darkness and that of light. guess which one s ours. oh, and , years ago a really super duper advanced civilization opened the portal, demons came over and had a blast, then wiped out the civilization. which is why we ve never heard of them, conveniently enough. br br christian slater, perhaps pining for the days of heathers and pump up the volume, plays edward carnby, a paranormal researcher to whom something bad happened when he was years old. he s hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization. carnby used to be part of a secret institution called , which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long ago civilization. but carnby believed he wasn t going to be able to find the answers he sought, so he left the group. br br but see, these beasties are out, and they get their prey in varying ways, such as gutting them, splitting them down the middle, implanting neurological control devices in them, or just turning them into killing zombies. yes, it s another zombie movie. br br that s about as distilled i can make the plot. it s pretty convoluted and incomprehensible. in similar movies, one might see the intrepid researcher adventurer figure things out a step at a time, and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher, it s a lot of fun. but when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context... not so much fun. br br the acting is dreadful, save for slater, who although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie showed he was capable of carrying the acting load. he had to get this tara reid is cast as a museum curator honest to goodness, i thought i d seen the casting of a lifetime when denise richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in tomorrow never dies. but reid here matches richards, crappy emoting for crappy emoting. hightlights include reid pronouncing newfoundland as new fownd land, reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed, throaty monotone kinda like she d been on an all night bender for the past week before filming , reid a museum curator, mind you spending a lot of the movie in a midriff bearing top and hip hugger jeans. oh yeah, she was as believable as jessica simpson giving stock quotes. oh, why must the pretty ones be so dumb note i don t think tara reid s all that good looking. she looks like she s in perpetual need of food. almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable, except perhaps for steven dorff, who played burke, one of the leaders of . dorff s character wasn t terribly well developed, but nothing in the movie was, from the sets to the characters to tara reid. but i digress. br br anyway, the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace, but director uwe boll tosses in a pounding, mind deadening soundtrack it s so loud you can t hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes that can t be right. given the acting level, however, perhaps thanks are in order to mr. boll. br br oh, and a fun note. the opening moments of the movie include narration... of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time. remember the first star wars you heard that now familiar star wars theme while the prologue crawled. there was surely no need for narration why do i need some doofus to read what s on the screen for me were the producers simply looking out for blind people maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud they were also looking out for hard of hearing people. also, the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl then lost it. bizarre. br br alone in the dark is a loud, dopey mishmash of dreadful acting, an incoherent script, and ham handed directing. hardly a note rings true. there s so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise. even in the dark, the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison. br br ironically, since there were only three other people in the theater, i watched this alone in the dark. i wonder if uwe boll planned it that way i can t quite give this the lowest rating, because i had low hopes for it to begin with and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it. it s atrocious, although slater redeems himself a tiny bit.\n",

            "Review: one of the most poetic narrative films ever made, wagonmaster is nonetheless a difficult film to immediately like. i love this movie, but i recommend seeing some of john ford s other westerns before taking a look at this one. the first time i saw it i was years old and i hadn t seen too many other westerns, and i hated it. i thought it was incredibly boring. i kept waiting for something to happen. it took several years for me to love this picture. first, i fell in love with westerns in general the traditions, characters, landscapes, ways of talking, etc and that made me realize when i saw wagonmaster again that a lot is happening in it after all. br br i also was simply a more experienced moviegoer at that point and had learned to appreciate visual storytelling, and to listen to what each image was telling me. wagonmaster is a very visual movie by one of the most visual of directors working near the peak of his career. br br the movie is a celebration of a way of life, and its subject matter is more emotional and interior than other ford westerns. actually, that s not really as accurate as saying that, rather, it has a lot less exterior action than the other westerns. the other westerns have exterior action and interior emotion. it quite beautifully places its mormon pioneers in the context of nature. there are many shots of animals and children not for any surface, narrative purpose, but for illustrating this idea. that is why the movie can be called a poem. it isn t about the surface story which barely exists nearly as much as it is about an emotional idea, and it gets this idea across through composition, editing, sound and music. in fact, one could argue that this is a purer form of filmmaking because the images directly express the emotional idea of the film, rather than having to first service a story. br br give this movie a chance, and allow it to exist on its own terms, not the terms of other westerns or other movies.\n",

            "Review: jon voight plays a man named joe. joe is shook up by a haunting childhood. he has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic baptism. he quits his job as a dishwasher and goes out to become a hustler for wealthy people. he meets a misfit named ratso dustin hoffman and the two for a relationship. they go out and work together in helping each other out. they become thieves. the two grow remarkably close and soon can t live without each other. however, there is something very important that ratso hasn t told joe, and it could destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together. this is one of the greatest films ever made. it is a heartbreaking and shattering portrait of too very lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other. their story is devastating to watch, but is ultimately important for people to see. it s one of those films where the characters are pretty much just like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street. the difference is that this film is from their perspective. their lives are shown to us and it s devastating to see the pedestrians in this film treat them like dirt, especially if we at one time were one of those people. however, the film doesn t try to guilt trip you. instead, it shows you the rough side of the lifestyle of hustling. it is not a pleasant and easygoing lifestyle like many hollywood films portray it such as milk money and pretty woman. the lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty, gritty, and ugly life and it s sad that people have degraded themselves like the character of joe in this film does. what startles me the most about this film was that it came out in , and it has stood the test of time perfectly. today s audiences will still find great meaning in this film and will still love it and cherish it just as much as critics and audiences did everywhere in . the film was rated x, but what i notice about this film is that the sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest, realistic, and effective way. anybody who has had sex before will know how humorous, awkward, and scary as hell it can be and this film doesn t shy away from any of that. the sex in this film may not be as graphic as in once was thought to be. movies that were x rated such as midnight cowboy, a clockwork orange, greetings, last tango in paris, and fritz the cat all seem remarkably tame compared to the shocking things that people can get away with an r rating today. the sex scenes in midnight cowboy will seem quite strong but they certainly aren t sexy. they are not graphic, but they are realistic, and that s what people should keep in mind when they view this film. the course language that is used in the film, particularly the word fag is used effectively and is not gratuitous. the violence is very shocking to watch even today, but again it is necessary to the plot to depict the world of a hustler. i m really glad to see that midnight cowboy is not dated and is still just as affecting as it was in , if not more. i can t recommend this classic enough and i do hope that it continues to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten. br br pros br br jon voight and dustin hoffman are both harrowing and amazing to watch. they have never played roles like this before or since and they are completely different from usual. you ll forget who is playing them within minutes br br beautiful score br br not at all dated or campy like many films of that decade come off as today br br fantastic and fast editing job br br cons br br for mature audiences only br br the opening scenes are well done, but they could be just a little stronger.\n",

            "Review: well, it has to be said that monster man is a huge mess of a film, but somehow multiple different genres and a plot come together to make one of the most enjoyable modern horror films i ve seen in ages the two biggest styles that the film mixes are a road trip style teenage comedy and a texas chainsaw massacre style redneck horror vibe, and while one gets in the way of the other quite often director michael davis manages to keep things moving thanks to the fact that the constant shift in tone means that we re never quite sure where the film is going to be taken next. things start out worryingly as we re introduced to two characters, both irritating in different ways. adam is a wussy virgin, while harley is a fat big mouthed a hole . they re both driving across the desert to attend the wedding of some chick they both liked in high school. after a couple of strange events, they pick up a hitch hiker, and then find themselves being chased by some maniac in a monster truck for reasons unknown... br br the idea of someone being chased by someone else in a bigger vehicle is hardly original, but the way the monster truck is used here is one of the film s biggest assets. the truck itself looks spooky because it s so haggard and rusty, and the fact that it bounces around the screen makes the unfolding action exciting and suspenseful. after a while, you begin to get used to the characters and once aimee brooks enters the fray, things start to look up. the teen comedy side of the movie actually works pretty well, as justin ulrich is always on hand to deliver some entertaining lines of dialogue and the scenes between the dorky virgin and the hot female hitch hiker are interesting enough. just when you think the film couldn t possibly get any messier, things take a turn for the weird in the final third. without spoiling things, it has to be said that monster man features the sort of ending that couldn t possibly be seen coming, and along with the twist, is a big surprise. some people may feel ripped off by the sudden turn at the end but i actually thought it worked quite well as it fits the film in that nothing here really fits... overall, this isn t a great film by any means but if you re looking for some silly entertainment, monster man should hit the spot \n",

            "Review: this movie was a complete disaster for me. there is one thing that movies must have in order to be watchable, and that is some psychological credibility of characters... unfortunately, here, this is not the case. the main characters behave irrationally most of the time, and even if they have some reason for such behavior, it is not revealed to us by the director. sophie marceau s character is particularly irritating, making pictures of everything throughout the whole movie, when one could expect something more rational for example meeting with her mother in the hospital ... and why exactly did she marry this guy no, this is not a spoiler the plot at times seems like ripped off some soap opera, and while the actors performance is not bad, this does not help much. all in all, i just could not find a way to connect with this movie. not that i tried too much after the first hour, though. i have never walked out of cinema during a movie, but this time was the closest in my life so far.\n",

            "Review: so after the initial disappointment of the first final fantasy movie, which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the final fantasy series, final fantasy advent children has released itself to a warm reception and, now, a dedicated fanbase. and the reason for the films success is understandable as it has lush graphics, fast moving fight sequences and some cool as hell characters. however, if you haven t played ff then it is likely that you will not enjoy this film as it s storyline carries on from the game without previous explanation and your likely to get lost from the plot even if you have played the game. secondly, there is no character development, without previous knowledge from the game your opinions on the characters are limited to cool and not cool . of course, for ff fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it s cool seeing all the characters you grew to love from the game rendered in some pretty amazing computer animation. one last complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, attempted to cram too much into less than two hours and therefore the last half hour or so seems horribly rushed. if you played and enjoyed ff than it is a worthwhile watch, though nothing too special. if you have not played ff then it is best that you play it first before watching this film.\n",

            "Review: i sort of liked this columbo movie its atmosphere, which was real thriller like and its approach even at times reminded me of film noir, in the movie its first minutes or so. it s really nice and done in a good old fashioned way, with the right camera angles and use of light. it doesn t mean instantly that this movie is a brilliant one though but its solid enough to consider this a good late columbo movie entry. it s definitely a better movie than the average later columbo movie entry. br br years after his previous columbo movie appearance, george hamilton returns once again to play the main lead opposite peter falk, again as the murderer, in a total different and new role of course. i liked him in his role and he was a good columbo villain , who gave the good old lieutenant some good competition. they had some nice sequences together. problem with the modern new columbo movies always sort of had been that it didn t feature a good well known actor opposite peter falk. this movie obviously doesn t suffer from this problem. but i must say though that this movie doesn t feature peter falk at this best. he has certainly played the character better and his performance isn t quite consistent enough within this movie, which is probably also due to he movie its director daryl duke, who also directed the really dreadful movie tai pan , among many other projects. br br it has a rather good and enjoyable story but the fact that the same sort of plot to cover up the murder had been used before in an earlier columbo movie also doesn t help of course. it got used before in the movie columbo playback . nevertheless it of course also still has plenty enough original moments of its own with its story, even though of course in essence every columbo movie is more or less the same. but oh well, that is what made the columbo series so great and consistent. if it ain t broke don t fix it. br br it also is true that within this movie more clues than usual are left out for the lieutenant, which doesn t mean that the movie its murderer is more stupid or sloppy but i more see it as the writers being more overly enthusiastic than others. it doesn t make the movie or story bad and it in fact perhaps even makes it more enjoyable, to see columbo hard at work and discovering all kind of small but important clues. luckily the movie is also filled with some enjoyable effective relieving columbo comedy. br br simply a good late columbo movie entry. br br \n",

            "Review: one of alfred hitchcock s three greatest films, along with psycho and the steps , strangers on a train is as brilliantly out of control as a merry go round in metcalf, and almost as deadly. it s the kind of film you have so much fun watching, you can t even feel properly guilty about it until you have time to catch your breath. br br top amateur tennis contender guy haines farley granger meets a singularly weird, louche stranger named bruno anthony robert walker on a train. thanks to the gossip pages, bruno knows all about guy s problems with his no good wife miriam, and rather gaily suggests they do each other a favor bruno will kill miriam and guy will kill bruno s father, who wants to put bruno in an institution. guy laughs it off, but bruno ain t kidding, as guy finds out to his peril. br br it s a great premise for a murder story, and hitchcock gives strangers on a train a run for all its worth, with the help of walker in perhaps the greatest performance in any hitchcock film, including anthony perkins in psycho . while perkins makes his mark playing tetchily against the grain, walker as anthony is one perfectly at home either buttering up old ladies at a swank dinner party or strangling a young woman at an amusement park. br br what drives bruno many commentators suggest his apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty guy. yes, bruno lights up the old gay dar, but guy seems happy enough on love s rebound with socialite anne morton ruth roman . bruno s interest for guy could just as easily be envy, for someone making a mark in the world while he lives at home, letting mommy file his nails. br br oh, i certainly admire people who do things, bruno purrs, looking like a cat eyeing a mouse. you know, it must be pretty exciting to be so important. br br later on, bruno calls himself a bum , accurate enough except for our rooting interest in him, even as he wrecks guy s life with his homicidal meddling. it s the ultimate perverse underdog s tale. there s a sense of integrity about bruno, in his dogged dedication, which commands our respect and which hitchcock plays to so brilliantly. when bruno floats away from the scene of his big crime, am i the only sick person in this world who s actually happy for him i think not, yet hitchcock keeps the story on a right enough path for us to realize how low we have fallen. we don t want bruno to win, exactly, but we enjoy his as he tries. br br everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough, to make every shot memorable. hitchcock always managed at least good setpiece sequences per movie here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone. big shows the neon side at the entrance says, and they aren t kidding. script, camera work, a gripping tennis match, ruth roman s jaw dropping figure, it s all too much greatness for one film to contain. even granger does his callow youth thing here with more risible plausibility than gregory peck ever managed. br br you can call this a clinic in movie making, but clinic sounds too dull. strangers on a train is good nasty fun, all the way through, leaving you with a nifty stinger at the tail as you realize you were rooting for the wrong stranger all along. heck, i ll take that ride over again in a second \n",

            "Review:  empire strikes back director irvin kershner s never say never again, a remake of the james bond movie thunderball, doesn t surpasses the terence young original, but this non harry saltzman albert r. broccoli film is well worth watching if you call yourself a aficionado. nevertheless, despite its shortage of clever gadgets and the lack of a vibrant musical score, never say never again rates as an above average, suspenseful doomsday thriller with top flight performances by a seasoned cast including sean connery, kim basinger, klaus maria brandauer, max von sydow, barbara carrera, edward fox, bernie casey, alec mccowen, and rowan atkinson. the film bristles with surprises galore from the invigorating title credits sequence throughout its generally exciting but lengthy minutes. unlike the franchise james bond sagas with their breath taking moments of spectacle, never say never again provides few of these scenes because of its prohibitive budget. indeed, the film features only three gadgets an explosive ball point pen, a wristwatch with a laser, and a souped up motorcycle. aside from the flavorful lani hall opening theme song, ice station zebra composer michel legrand s orchestral music score leaves much to be desired. legrand replicates none of those snappy, jazz cues that made john barry s music for the regular bond franchise so memorable. all in all, never say never again seems to fit more into the first two bond no and from russia with on her majesty s secret service in terms of its more down to earth approach to the subject matter. br br never say never again presents sean connery s james bond as an older who has seen his day and has been taken off active service to teach. ironically, roger moore was a year older than connery and moore s bond movies treated as an active, young guy. sean connery seems to be responsible for making a more mature secret agent and a number of changes take place in the lorenzo semple screenplay that emphasize bond s age. initially, connery had lobbied to play bond without a hairpiece, but mercifully wiser minds prevailed and connery sports a hairpiece. he looks tanned and fit and appears in better condition than he did twelve years earlier when he was rushed into diamonds are forever at the last moment to replace john gavin. connery had been working on another movie and had gained weight for the role that he was unable to remove in time for diamonds are forever. at , connery still has a youthful vigor here despite the contrived demands of the script. br br the action unfolds with single handedly trying to rescue a kidnapped woman on a remote desert island. he dispatches several guards armed with machine guns and frees the woman, only to have her stab him with a knife in the side when he isn t looking. it seems that this entire sequence was an exercise designed by m edward fox of day of the jackal to test bond s ability. the new m doesn t share his predecessor s use of field agents. m decides that bond needs to clean out his system of all free radicals and has packed off to shrublands. while at the country clinic, bond notices suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and gets noticed watching them. the nurse is none other than spectre assassin fatima blush barbara carrera of the island of dr. moreau and she is in charge of making sure that nobody sees usaf officer jack petachi gavan o herlihy of superman . petachi is part of a spectre plan by millionaire businessman maximilian largo klaus maria brandauer of out of africa to black the world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads. the villains implant a duplicate eyeball into captain petachi who has access to the highly sophisticated computers and can order the arming of weapons. after he steals the weapons for spectre, fatima blush runs him off the road by tossing her pet snake in his lap and then attaches an explosive to his wrecked car and blows him up. indeed, the first part of never say never again, apart from the spectre planning conference, belong to fatima as she supervises petachi s stay at the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill bond, one at sea with sharks and later in a motel suite with an explosives device. br br eventually, bond meets the beautiful blond domino kim basinger of mother lode and sneaks into largo s charity banquet at a monte carlo casino where the two face off in an elaborate video game called domination to see who will rule the world. bond bests him and largo hates him doubly now because is his only rival to domino and a thorn in his side that not even fatima seems to be able to remove. bond and fatima have it out after a motorcycle chase when he returns the favor and blows her up. their earlier encounter in the bahamas when she attached a device to lure a shark after him is pretty lame. like in the original thunderball, the villains recover the hijacked nuclear warheads at sea, but just the warheads themselves. br br bond flies to the bahamas where he meets his diplomatic liaison, nigel small fawcett no lesser than rowan atkinson of mr. bean fame, who is worried that bond may kill somebody and ruin the island paradise. of course, nigel small fawcett serves as the film s source of comic relief. the c.i.a. sends felix leiter bernie casey of guns of the magnificent seven to back up bond. this is the first time that an african american portrayed leiter. bond encounters his share of problems, involving saving domino from arab slavers, while leiter and he save the world. never say never again is a richly respectable james bond thriller with many neat touches, but it never generates the air of danger that the franchise bond films have. indeed, never say never again looks like a dignified masterpiece theatre take on .\n",

            "Review:  a lot of the films i ve made probably could have worked just as well years ago, and that s just because i have a lot of old fashion values. steven spielberg br br some points.. br br . though this film is a loose remake of a guy named joe , it also borrows heavily from a matter of life and death and wings of desire . br br . this was spielberg s second attempt at being frank capra. br br . spielberg has often said that he wishes to make a frank capra movie in the vein of it s a wonderful life and mrs smith goes to washington . judging from his recent attempts to get a harvey remake off the ground, it seems as though spielberg still holds this dream, the director rightfully not satisfied with his last ventures into capracorn. br br . critics at the time bashed always , stating that the elaborate action sequences distracted from the film s romance, but that s really not the problem at all. the problem is that always needs a lot more special effects to distract us from the fact that spielberg can t film any line of dialogue that doesn t end in an exclamation point. br br . the film is filled with comedy that just doesn t work. spielberg s comedic tastes aren t very sophisticated, and seem to be ripped right out of s screwballs and looney tune cartoons. these exaggerated antics may work in a cartoon universe, but in a film it just seems like an odd marriage. br br . the film s lead couple come across as brother and sister, not lovers. spielberg s films have always being apprehensive toward sex and intimacy, but this film goes to extreme lengths she s a wisecracking tomboy and he s a wisecracking old man. they re more irritating than endearing. br br . the film contains one good scene, in which john goodman argues with holly hunter, but for the most part the film s characters are too annoying. there s no subtlety, every emotion overplayed, every joke over designed, every sequence filled with unnecessary busyness. br br . always and hook taught spielberg how to con audiences. after their failure and the twin financial failures of the color purple and empire of the sun spielberg dumped the goofy colour cinematography of color purple and empire of the sun in favour for the more desaturated black and white worlds of schindler s list , munich , minority report and saving private ryan . from here on, less light and dark cinematography became equated with serious topics . br br . after the financial success of each dark film spielberg reverts back to his colour cinematography, and falls flat on his face once again. amistad followed schindler s list , ai followed ryan and lincoln will follow munich . these colour films are always bashed for being too tacky, sentimental, corny and hokey, but the truth is, if you removed the desaturation, all these serious films would feel the same way. br br . since the s, spielberg has tried to differentiate himself from the other brat pack directors scorsese, de palma, coppola etc , by pretending to be an optimist and humanist . he would himself state this repeatedly during many interviews in the late s. the reality, though, is that he is probably the biggest sadist of all these directors, the very form of his films often undermining their content, their very box office performances always proportionate to their dazzling displays of carnage. br br . the failure of spielberg to connect with any of the characters in always , and the relish he shows, instead, for filming forest fires, air planes crashing etc, perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography. people running from dinosaurs, sharks, nazis, tripods, rocks etc...this is what spielberg delights in. the moment his characters stop to speak, however, everything self destructs. a film like amistad failed, in other words, because not enough blacks died and too many whites talked. br br . the film s flying scenes aren t up to the standard s set several years earlier in the mega hit top gun . of course, when your enemy is a forest fire, it s hard to make things cinematic. br br . failures like , hook , always etc are often more illuminating that spielberg s more successful films. they reveal the steel skeleton beneath the technique. they show what the amusement park ride looks like when its not working, revealing the vacuum beneath the broken machinery. br br there s one good sequence here two actors in a room, simply improvising , but this is mostly an annoying picture with a predictable script. br br worth one viewing.\n",

            "Review: fragile carne, just before his great period. although it is sometimes hesitantly directed, and marred by longueurs, hotel du nord is full of the faded charm and beauty typical of french films of the late s, as well as a relative lightness of touch unusual with this director. all of his great virtues are here the cramped interiors broken up by gliding, complex, delicious camera movements a melancholy deployment of light and shade remarkable, wistful sets by alexander trauner, which are so evocative that they, as the title suggests, take on a shaping personality of their own the quietly mournful music of maurice jaubert a seemingly casual plot about romance, tragedy and fatalism that casts a noose over its characters extraordinary performances by some of the greatest players of all time, in this case louis jouvet and arletty. br br in fact, the film s biggest failing, and i find myself astonished as someone who usually, didactically, minimises its importance to admit it, is its script. it has plenty of wit and poignancy, but without the poetry and irony regular carne collaborator jacques prevert brought to their best films, it cannot avoid slipping into cliche even if it is only cliche in hindsight . br br ostensibly set in the boarding house, the film sets up its opening idea of community with two interconnecting tales of doomed love, and emotional, metaphysical and actual isolation the doomed love scenario is the one that works least well. annabella is very beautiful, but not very good at doing tragic, while aumont s callowness, brilliantly appropriate though it may be, by its nature obtrudes any real, felt, romance. maybe it s just me, but i find it hard to sympathise with a couple, so young, so attractive, who, after only a few months, are so racked with despair that they have to shoot each other. their high flown lines are rather embarrassing too. of course, this affair is not meant to be plausible they are symbolic of youth, hope and possibility being crushed in france, or maybe france itself, despairing, resigned, waiting for death. for symbols to be truly powerful, they must convince on a narrative level, which, i feel, they don t quite here. br br what saves this plot is its connection with the story of m. edmond, a character linked to the great tradition of french gangsters. although we only learn it gradually, he is a killer in hiding, living off the prostitute played by arletty, having dobbed in his accomplices. in his previous role and the theatricality of his position is crucial he had one set of traits in hiding he has assumed their complete opposite. living a rather aimless life, he is profoundly shaken by the lovers pact, and becomes fatalistic, realising the folly of trying to cheat death. br br in this way the admission that one is less a person than a collection of signs, and that death is an unavoidable reality the most powerful masculinity must succumb to edmond is like a romantic prototype of melville s clinical killers. with one exception he gives briefly into hope, a delusion which only strenghtens if that s not too much of an unbearable irony his fatal resolve. br br all this could have been trite if it wasn t for the truly amazing performance of louis jouvet. i had studied his theatrical work at college, but this was my first taste of his screen talents, and he reveals himself to be worthy of the greats grant, mastroianni, clift, mason, mitchum, cotten giving a quiet nobility to a role which is more of a conception he, needless to say, is allegorical too than an actual person. edmond begins the film a minor supporting character, but emerges as a tragic hero of some force. like all those major actors, jouvet s brilliance lies in what he conceals. br br on a formal level, what amazes is carne s grasping, ten years before its flourishing, of the techniques of the great hollywood melodramas of sirk, ophuls, ray and minnelli. although his theatricality lacks the fluidity and clear eyed beauty of sierck s contemporary german melodramas check out the masterpieces zu neuen ufern and la habenera , carne s style truly fits his theme that of entrapment, paralysis, resignation. br br the film s principle motif is that of water the credits float and dissolve, the hotel stands by a waterway but instead of renoir s open river of possibility, we have a canal, stagnant and manmade, going nowhere. the film begins as it ends, and the setting never changes, except for one brief interlude from which both escapees are doomed to return. characters can only escape through death their entrapment is emphasised by the narrow rooms they occupy, the walls and frames that hold them captive, the windows that look out on an escape they can never achieve. any hope at the end, therefore, is profoundly, if romantically, compromised.\n",

            "Review: this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed. while late and into would reveal just how evil and horrific they were, this film, unlike other hollywood films to date, is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocities. br br the film begins in a courtroom in the future after the war is over the film was made in the war ended in may, . in this fictitious world court, a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes. wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimm s life since in a series of flashbacks. at first, it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis. however, after a while, it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster. these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama. br br all in all, the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second tier actors. there are many compelling scenes and performances especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that can t help but bring you close to tears. it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first. overall, it s a must see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film. br br fyi this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film, but hitler was referred to as that paper hanger . this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper. this is in fact not true previously he d been a starving artist , homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi. a horrible person, yes, but never a paper hanger \n",

            "Review: farrah fawcett has spent the better part of her post angel s career confounding us, with an occasional noteworthy acting performance sandwiched in between her playboy frolics and letterman escapades. but when it comes down to it, there s no denying that this girl can act. far from a story of epic proportions, this well done tv movie is gentle, quiet and occasionally moving. fawcett plays the wayward black sheep daughter come home only to find that she missed the last days of her mom s life as well as the funeral, much to the chagrin of her more stable and presumably more sensible sister. brad johnson plays the love interest, and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of telefilm drama but then there s always that confounding farrah to watch, and she does, indeed, remain eminently watchable. and, yes, i admit it, i did have that farrah poster on my wall way back when . silk hope gets three and a half stars out of five on the corkymeter. bosley would be proud.\n",

            "Review: just as the whole cast and crew knows f all about film making. br br this film concerns the adventures and predicaments of a modern day cockney vampire assassin, and an age old spat with her seemingly jaded vampire lover. that plot in itself reeks of and promises of boredom when on as small a scale a film as this, and that s exactly what you get. br br first off let me say that i by no means dismiss films because they are b movies, in fact some of my favourite films are b movies such as jesus christ vampire hunter, but this one misses the mark by a mile. br br anyone with any knowledge of small budget films will know that the acting is rarely gripping and emotional, but razor blade smile creates a whole new dimension of hamming it up on screen. some of the so called acting is just indescribably bad, with characters spewing cheesy one liners that fall flat, and discourse expressing about as much emotion and conviction as the terminator after a couple of horse tranquillisers. br br a vast portion of the film is also taken up by the vampiric characters, the protagonist in particular, unnecessarily flapping their mouths, showing off their ridiculously large vampire teeth and exhaling very loudly. it literally must happen in almost every scene at least once, and quickly became annoying and pointless, as if that many looks of slack jawed supposedly scary vampire faces were used to merely fill a little bit of time and pad out the rest of this turd sandwich of a film. br br contrary to what some of the other reviewers believe on here, i feel this film the director in particular is really trying to take this film seriously in many parts. the sheer number of overly dramatic action shots and extreme close ups seems to indicate to me that the director really wanted people to feel this film and make it legitimate to its genre and not spoof it, and he fails miserably. the attempts at supposedly tasteful sex scenes come out as comic and silly and the action sequences are sometimes just plain stupid. br br also the ending of this film was one of the weakest and most pathetic conclusions i have seen to a film, b movie or not. when films such as this force you to sit through hours of themselves only to be rewarded with a oh it was all a game ending it is actually sickening. it the conclusion to the plot feels like an afterthought of the director that he figured out on the last day of shooting because they had run to the end of their shoestring budget. br br but i have not rated this film as one star despite the overwhelming crappiness, and this is because of the only plus point i can really give this film. intentionally or not, it was funny. i am fairly sure the parts i found humorous were not intended to be, and i found most of the efforts at genuine gags to be fruitless, but when watched with friends it is a good film to take the mickey out of.\n",

            "Review: as a big jim carey fan i took my seat in the cinema with optimism. after all, fun with dick and jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another carey success. after the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in. the idea that a charming, charismatic, top v.i.p employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible. the actors seem confused with the situation as well. of course, the stereotypical, rich, uncaring head of the operation doesn t struggle one bit to pull off his one dimensional character but for carey and others around him the job is a whole lot harder. one minute dick is seen as a cocky office pro, obsessed with possessions, the next minute he s a bumbling mess who can barely string two words together, and ultimately he becomes a petty thief who is able, quite happily, to put a gun to another man s head. jane is equally confused with her role and her character never really gets going. br br the idea behind the story is such a good one and it is a shame that this film has not managed to make it work. the odd moment of laugh out loud comedy can be found but it is usually more physical humour than anything witty or clever. carey tries his best in parts to save a sinking ship but his comic talent can never flourish in a character that has so many gaping holes to his personality. carey shines when he is presented with a strong, daring character man on the moon, the truman show, ace ventura which this film never presented him with, despite its best efforts.\n",

            "Review: i watched the unrated version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of speck closely, i must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious take on the real story. while capturing the true horror of speck and the murders this film makes the following factual errors. . speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie. in fact he was mainly an alcoholic and pill popper who rarely took drugs via syringe. . the asian nurse who survived speck s massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie. this would have been impossible. in real life she hid under a bed while speck methodically eliminated his victims. . the movie depicts speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them. not true. in reality speck was at first calm and gentle, reassuring the women he wasn t going to hurt them. this is how he was able to tie each of them up. . the real richard speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be. fbi profiler robert ressler interviewed speck in the s and said that speck not only did nt know why he committed the murders but that he wasn t interested in learning why nor could he shed any light on why. speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie. if the story wasn t so tragic and horrifying, the voice over would be laughable. all in all, doug cole s performance is adequately menacing and cold blooded even though i don t think the real speck was so forward in his violence. no doubt he was a very violent person when under the influence but he was also known, after all, for being a fairly slick con man who was able to put people at ease before victimizing them. beverly ann sotelo s performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film. she is a very good actress. if you are at all squeamish, do not see this film. it s very graphic and disturbing.\n",

            "Review:  br br summary not worth the film br br as an avid gone with the wind fan, i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. when the book scarlett came out, i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. while the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as i was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable. however, i consider the six hours i spent watching the scarlett miniseries to be some of the worst spent hours of my life. discrediting any of the original character traits so well formed in margaret mitchell s book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from. the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. in the novel, scarlett o hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. after coming to an arrangement with rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her o hara relatives in savannah. eventually, she accompanies her cousin colum, a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood, to ireland, to further explore her family s roots that go deep, and is eventually named the o hara, the head of the family. while her duties as the o hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara, scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners, and instantly becomes a sought after guest at many of their parties. she, having been scorned by rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry luke, the earl of fenton, until rhett comes along in a night on white horse type of a rescue. the scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice. raped by her and scorned by her family, the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed. br br i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision. br br \n",

            "Review: i attended a screening of fierce people at the woodstock film festival. i hesitate to label it a premiere of any sort, since it was shot in the spring of and had its world premiere at tribeca in . it played several festivals that year. release seemed imminent, then it disappeared. poof. vanished. or so it appeared to the film going public. rumors of a theatrical or dvd release have popped up now and then, but all proved unfounded. then this screening was announced. perhaps one can call it a re premiere it certainly felt as if i was witness to a buried treasure. and what a treasure it was. br br i suppose one could characterize fierce people as a coming of age drama. but it also has elements of comedy and tragedy, as well as mystery. and a bit of farce thrown in. in short, real life. that makes it hard to pigeonhole, which puts it more into the category of an indie as opposed to a hollywood movie. but its high production values, big budget feel, and star caliber cast seem at odds with the indie label. so let s call it a hybrid. and, perhaps, that s why it s been lost. it defies categorization. br br meet finn earl anton yelchin , , whose father is absent. in fact, finn has never known him. but he sees him and hears him via the collection of home movies sent from south america. dad is a renowned anthropologist, and has made a name for himself by setting up shop with the yanomani, the tribe of fierce people who live to kill and, well, procreate. all their activities are built around those two tasks, and finn is captivated by it. mom liz diane lane is also somewhat absent. although present physically, she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol. so finn becomes an adult in his little solitary world with his reels of film. br br one summer, mom decides to drag finn along with her into the wilds of new jersey. a massage therapist, mom has catered to a wealthy client, ogden c. osborne donald sutherland, in a tour de force performance and he has invited her for an extended house call at his palatial estate. osborne s tribe includes an assortment of eccentric rich kids, servants, and village idiots among whom finn will find himself part of his own anthropological study. will his experience with dad s films help him survive life as a visitor to this tribe will he be accepted or will he be seen as an outsider, concurrently struggling with his own identity as an adolescent such is the stuff of fairy tales, and i suppose this would be if not for the dark underbelly which director griffin dunne and writer dirk wittenborn have infused into this magnificent story. br br with anton yelchin s voice over, intercutting pieces of dad s home movies, finn must learn to go back to being the teenager he never really had a chance to be, stop being the parent to his mom, allow newly sober mom to be parent to him, and learn responsibility on the way to adulthood the way it should have taken place all along. yet he needs to make this transformation in a dangerous, dark world where playing with fire is folly to this fractured family. br br this is, first and foremost, a story driven film and griffin dunne emphasized as much in the intro to the film. he bought the rights to wittenborn s novel even as it was being written, and wittenborn s own screenplay comes to life in the hands of the masterful dunne in a way that s a work of wonder. br br this is also largely a character driven film, and sutherland has never been better. his star turn as osborne stunned those around me and will likely leave you amazed as well. diane lane s character ultimately exhibits so many personalities that it s hard to imagine another actor pulling it off so well. she is breathtaking. but more than anything, fierce people is anton yelchin s film. he has a long resume as a child actor but preciously little as a teen. other than the little known house of d also a gem , he is best known as byrd on tv s huff. in january, he will be seen in alpha dog also sitting on the shelf since , a film i saw at sundance this year and in which he is the heart and soul . his performance here goes far beyond what one would expect from someone so young, and is nothing short of spectacular. br br this complex, quirky film has remained out of sight long enough. fierce people is a treasure filled with light and shadow, comedy and tragedy, joy and pathos, but mostly wonder.\n",

            "Review: i can t believe that none of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two quite upsetting sexual assault scenes. it s as though our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent. my biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn t seem to condemn these assaults as in, the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressured never holds the men accountable for their actions, and neither does anyone else. one man is stopped from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him, but he is reprimanded only with you cannot force a woman to love you rather than you should never force a woman sexually, you jerk ... from a woman s point of view, the movie is a let down. it sort of throws a bone to women in letting them be both skilled fighters and leaders, but the movie is much more defined by the romance which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power, with men dominating the woman they love. this amazing martial arts fighter doesn t use any of her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers. she never even makes them apologize rather, she seems apologetic. overall, a depressing and upsetting movie, with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes, but not as good as hero by a long shot.\n",

            "Review: daisy movie review by james mudge from beyondhollywood.com br br on paper, daisy sounds like an asian film fan s dream come true, directed by infernal affairs co helmer andrew lau and starring everybody s favourite sassy girl, popular korean actress jeon ji hyun. unfortunately, despite the talent involved, and the fact that the crew flew halfway around the world to shoot in amsterdam , the film turns out to be a bit of a disappointment, being a clich d romantic drama which wallows in misery and self importance. br br the plot follows hye young jeon ji hyun , a rather naive korean girl who lives in amsterdam , spending her life working in her grandfather s antique shop and doing portraits for tourists. one day, she begins receiving flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer, who she believes to be a mystery man from her past who once built her a nice little bridge. one day she meets jeong woo lee seong jae, also in holiday and public enemy , who unbeknownst to her is actually an interpol agent tracking asian criminals in the netherlands . br br with hye young assuming that jeong woo is responsible for the flowers, the two fall very slowly into a chaste romantic relationship. however, it turns out that the man sending the flowers is actually park yi jung woo sung, from sad movie and musa , an assassin working for a chinese crime syndicate. inevitably, the love triangle turns tragic and the two men end up facing off while poor hye young tries to work out which of the two is the love of her life. br br although daisy is ostensibly a love story, it has the feel of a funeral, with a slow, sombre pace and a plot which piles on the misery. half of the film s running time is taken up with scenes of the characters staring longingly out of windows into the rain, with the silence broken only by bouts of self pitying narration. director lau seems to be under the impression that the film is a weighty shakespearean tragedy, rather than yet another gloomy hit man love story. as such, the proceedings have a rather pretentious air, despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and based largely around glaring borrowed liberally from the likes of fulltime killer and john woo s classic the killer . br br almost every aspect of the film is riddled with angst, with the three lead characters suffering as if the weight of the world was on their shoulders, and steadfastly refusing to do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations. park yi in particular, as the kind of overly emotional, socially retarded assassin so beloved of modern cinema, is faintly ludicrous, from his blatant incompetence on the job to his hilarious attempts to discuss impressionist painting with hye young or his penchant for flower growing. this languid passivity does make the film s central romance somewhat hard to swallow, and lau s attempts to evoke the feeling that it is fate which brings the characters together comes across more as shoddy coincidence. br br fans of jeon ji hyun should note that her character is far closer to her role in the glum supernatural drama the uninvited than my sassy girl or windstruck , and while she tries her best to pull a few wacky faces here and there, her performance is certainly more subdued. br br the film benefits from glossy production values, and lau makes good use of the amsterdam scenery, playing on the contrast between the grey, almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue skies and flowery fields of the countryside. unfortunately, he tends to overuse slow motion for some of the emotional scenes, which when coupled with some of the picture postcard visuals gives the film the feel at times of a perfume advert. there are a few scenes of surprisingly violent action, though these are few and far between, and whilst well staged, seem to have been thrown in as an afterthought and do little more than briefly raising the pulse. br br despite its flaws, daisy makes for engaging viewing, and the story grips almost in spite of itself, mainly out of a morbid fascination to see not which of the men hye young will end up with, but to see who will lie dying in her arms. the self indulgent melodrama works well enough to tick all the right boxes for the genre, and the film functions perfectly well as an enjoyably glossy, weepy romance. br br it is worth noting that the dvd features the director s cut of the film, which for once indicates that it is substantially different from the theatrical version, which not only adds minutes, but reorders some of the scenes, making the narrative less linear. although this new version is perhaps too long, it is surely superior, as without these changes, the film would surely have been even more conventional and would have suffered from even murkier character development. br br wai keung lau director jae young kwak screenplay cast woo sung jung . park yi sung jae lee . jeong woo david chiang

            "Review: i was excited to discover this late sixties comedy staring some of my favorite people maggie smith, a very young bob newhart and, of course, peter ustinov. my disappointment was thus compounded to discover the film doesn t work as either a comedy or a perfect heist film. ustinov plays a small time crook just out of prison who sets his sites on a large american corporation based in london. bluffing his way past dimwitted ceo karl malden and tech geek newhart, ustinov passes himself off as a computer expert and immediately plans the perfect heist part of the film. to do this he needs to get passed a tamper proof security system that guards the corporation mainframe. and here is problem one. his perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is remarkably trusting and stupid. his lame excuses are taken at face value and this must be the only computer center anywhere not to bother with video cameras. the second problem is the heist fraud really happens within the first minutes of the film robbing the rest of the picture of much in way of dramatic tension. maggie smith is sadly miscast as ustinov s ditsy next door neighbor secretary who just can t keep a job. i love maggie smith but she just seems too together here, too composed, the part called for more of a wacky, physical comedian. furthermore, ustinov and smith have no chemistry together, maybe it s the age difference, but the later romantic relationship, as devoid of actual romance as it is, still comes off a little creepy. ustinov co wrote the script, and it was thought well of at the time, but i found it unfunny, meandering and a sad waste of a great cast.\n",

            "Review: the fact that this film was distributed free with a certain national newspaper which i do not care for did, to a degree, put me off of watching it, but as i had come across a copy that a local charity shop was giving away for nothing i felt i could watch it with a clear conscience. br br the film does have its moments, the evocation of the thameside location is nicely done, but it does suffer, i feel, from a few too many faults. firstly, vinnie jones is simply not convincing as the journalist. whilst vinnie himself is an interesting character, the truth is that he simply does not have the range of acting ability to pull off a role like this. br br secondly, who would carry around with them a lost manuscript that they have been informed is priceless it seemed that everywhere mr jones went this manuscript went with him thirdly, the whole dickens aspect of the story, whilst appearing to be important, gets in the way of what could have been an interesting film of corruption in high places. maybe i m just a bit thick, but i really could not see the point of the story within a story dickens style. this added nothing to the film, and only served to confuse matters when things started to become interesting within the modern day story line. br br the one bit of praise i will give the film makers is that at least they did attempt something a little different. i am all for british independent films that try to be out of left field , but this is not a red road or this is england . what it is is a bit of a mess, and an over long one at that. yes, it entertains in part, but in the end it felt like two films merged together to make a whole, and failing both by doing so. also, i can not help think that i have seen something similar done recently on tv by ian banks, set in edinburgh with a story concerning sir arthur conan doyle, the creator of sherlock holmes .\n",

            "Review: i hadn t heard of this film until i read an article about it on the unknown movies website, which made me curious. as a cartoonist and illustrator myself, i m an admirer of richard williams s work i rate ziggy s gift as one of the finest christmas specials of all time, and even though who framed roger rabbit stopped being one of my favourite films when i got past the age of sixteen, i still have the highest of regard for the amount of work, care and attention to detail that went into creating the visuals but it seems the man has his faults, most notably a propensity for going over budget and over schedule, and this film is a testament of just how far wrong even a super talented individual like williams can go, given the right circumstances. br br raggedy ann and andy is a strange confection that tries to be weird and experimental and off the wall within the confines of a children s cartoon. it tries also to be a musical. it tries to be a thousand and one other things as well is it a freakout is it a mind blower is it a paean to the innocence of childhood imagination until it finally collapses under the weight of its own limitless ambitions and aspirations. it s beautifully animated, for the most part, though the bland backgrounds could have used a little more attention, but even that doesn t count for much when you re confronted with the hallucinogenic absurdity that constitutes much of the action here. br br there are a number of problems with the film, but let s start with raggedy ann and andy themselves. they re the stars of the show, yet they have no personalities. actually, we get the message that andy is a wannabe tough guy i m no girl s toy , he sings and that ann has a unique perspective on things because her owner, a little girl called marcella, carries her upside down, but that s all we get to find out about these dull as mud characters because the overwhelming weirdness of this film kicks in not long after. i use the word weirdness advisedly, because some weird films can be hugely entertaining, but this is just flat out strange. the toys and dolls in the playroom are supposed to be cute and lovable, but they re actually bizarre and disturbing. the two marionettes who do and say everything in sync are a prime example of this. but even they re relatively normal compared to the constantly sneezing pirate captain, whose moustache becomes erect and whose groin visibly swells when he first catches sight of a glamorous french doll. yes, this is supposed to be a children s film then there s the music, none of which is memorable, and all of which is sung by actors who can t sing. and to add insult to injury, there s a lot of singing in this film. when ann and andy finally make it out of the playroom, the first thing they do is sing a long number in the woods about how scared they are, about how they ll always have each other and...yes, we get the message. this seems to go on forever, but at least it brings some semblance of normality back to the film. not for long, though, because the camel with the wrinkled knees leads us into a bizarre world where everything looks like it s made from worn and faded denim, and bad enough that he s clearly a paranoid schizophrenic he also starts hallucinating. but this is nothing compared to the scenes that follow. the greedy, a living, breathing. belching, farting, constantly eating pool of taffy, is so trippy, creepy and ultimately disturbing, you ll hardly believe what you re seeing this is as close to a drug free psychedelic experience as i ve ever seen on film. then, after a l o n g time spent with the greedy, along comes the psychotic sir leonard looney and his master king kookoo, whose throne resembles a urinal. i can t believe i m actually writing a capsule description of a real film here i just had to rub my eyes and remind myself that i m not blogging about an overwhelmingly whacked out nightmare i had. part of the sequence in looney land resembles one of the old winsor mccay little nemo cartoons, for no good reason other than somebody felt like doing it, probably. all this would be fine if there was some kind of rhyme or reason behind it, but there isn t. these scenes are just strange, and very, very long. surrealism only works when there s a strong idea behind it, or takes place against some semblance of reality. but nothing in these scenes points towards any kind of reality. take away this element, and you re left with pure self indulgence. br br as the final scenes unravel, even the animation begins to look less impressive the pirate ship, ludicrously detailed, jerks about on the water in a manner that suggests some of the cels went missing during the production and there s a non event of an ending that simply suggests money ran out. even at a meagre minutes in length, the film feels like a never ending ordeal, and it s understandable why it flopped on its original release. animation buffs will probably scratch their heads and wonder just how williams managed to flub this one so spectacularly, but he did, and there s nothing anyone can do about it.\n",

            "Review: roy anderson s film you, the living comprises a series of fifty odd sketches, snapshots and vignettes set in a swedish city. some characters are on screen for just a few second, whilst others appear in numerous scenes and are sometimes seen loitering in the background while another story unfolds. many scenes are drawn from the dreams, nightmares and fantasies of the strange but believable characters inhabiting this world. it is a fascinating approach each of the scenes could be enjoyed in isolation, but together they contain a powerful portrait of what it is to be human. br br for the first half hour or so, you, the living is gloriously funny. much of the humour centres on the members of a brass band, whose music practice infuriates the neighbours in their apartment block. the comic highlight, however, is provided by a dinner party track gone horribly awry. after this hilarious introduction, however, the mood of the film darkens considerably. the dinner party dream turns grim when the hapless protagonist is put on trial for his life, setting a mixed tone of absurdity and despair for the rest of the film. br br in the subsequent scenes, the unhappiness of the cast of characters becomes increasingly apparent. theirs is a world where people are unable to connect with one another, where talk of dreams, nightmares and fantasies is widespread, but where no person can be comforted, even when others reach out to help them. the despondent woman with the nobody loves me refrain and the young girl with unrequited love for the rock guitarist, micke, are archetypal characters. br br the world of you, the living is also blighted by selfishness. an elderly professor is called away the warmth of a vast banquet to answer a phone call from his impetuous money grubbing son a thief steals the wallet of a ruthless executive an arrogant and impatient businessman insults a muslim barber and receives his comeuppance. in the film s bleakest moment, a woman in church recounts the long list of human sins as her fellow parishioners shuffle out at closing time. br br and yet, for all dark moments in this film, the shared refrain of tomorrow is another day points to the ability of people to go on living in spite of many miseries. the soundtrack provided by benny anderson of abba fame seems inappropriately jovial at first but makes more and more sense as the film realises this human capacity to persevere. br br you, the living has an extraordinary visual style. the same washed out, pale green colours recur throughout, and there is nary a shadow in sight this makes the characters appear exceptionally pallid and creates the sensation that human life is being laid bare for examination. almost every scene is captured in a static camera frame, as if these are photographs being brought to life. the few occasions where the camera does move are all the more extraordinary the contrast between the life and movement of the great banquet form a startling contrast with the deadness of the cloakroom scene. in the most intense moments of longing and despair, the characters transfix the viewer by directly facing the camera they know that they are being examined and have a few moments to pour out their hearts to us, the viewers. br br this is a wonderful, human film.\n",

            "Review:  umi wa miteita the sea is watching was akira kurasawa s swansong to film his adaptation of his favored novelist shugoro yamamoto s story into a screenplay he intended to film was his final mark he left on a brilliant career. director kei kumai pays homage to both kurosawa and yamamoto in presenting this visually stunning transformation of word to image. br br set in th century japan, the story explores the lives of the women of a geisha house whose sole purpose in life is to earn money by pleasuring men. the house is run by an older couple who are genteel and the geishas are an enchanting group of women who know their trade and take pride in their careers. each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha. oshin nagiko tono supports her family who live in a neighboring village, kikuno misa shimizu has customers both good and evil whom she manages to sustain with her stories of her higher caste. oshin befriends an endangered samurai, falls in love with the gentle fellow, only to find that he must not marry out of his caste and leaves his pleasures with oshin to marry his promised betrothed. oshin s heart bruises easily but is always supported emotionally and physically monetarily by kikuno and the other geishas. br br a handsome samurai ryosuke masatoshi nagase enters oshin s life and develops the first trusted and devoted relationship with her. kikuno is beset by problems, deciding whether to accept the humble love of an old man who wishes to marry her, and coping with a rich but abusive customer. all the while the sea is watching and as a typhoon destroys the geisha house and street, oshin and kikuno sit atop the roof waiting for the promised rescue by ryosuke. the manner in which the story ends is one of sacrifice, love, and devotion. the sea is watching and will find protection for true love. br br the photography by kazuo okuhara is breathtakingly beautiful night scenes with glowing lanterns and colorful geisha interiors are matched with recurring glimpses of the sea both calm and turbulent. the acting is a bit strained for edo art, but the characters are well created and keep the story credible. the one distraction which is definitely not something kurosawa would have condoned is the tacky western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real japanese music on authentic instruments graces the track. but in the end there is enough of kurosawa s influence to imbue this film with his brand of dreamlike wonder that will always maintain his importance on world cinema. grady harp\n",

            "Review: where the heck is andreas trond fausa aurvaag , exactly heaven hell a parallel universe when the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an onrushing train, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus riding solo, the newest arrival, in a dead netherworld where all the suicides go. dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere, andreas is greeted by an official man, who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city, if the eyeballs work, is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited, if memory serves him right. andreas retains the look of a sleepwalker in a trance, a man estranged from people and objects, struggling to find his bearings at home, or rather, his assigned apartment or at work, where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. havard johannes joner , his boss, tells him, you ll get used to it, which covers more than just crunching numbers, we suspect, in this world, same as the old world. br br if life is meaningless, like french existentialist philosopher jean paul satre said, the same can be said for death, as well. the subculture of office life might be heaven for one man, but it looks like hell to us, under the context that den brysomme mannen operates on. to work in the afterlife, in essence, is to work for the rest of your life. the social intercourse among andreas office mates may pass as normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer, as he she now recognizes the drudgery of white collar labor performed by white collar laborers, who kill the hours with their inconsequential small talk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day like automotons, each and every day, seem irrational in its self evident absurdity. to see daily life replicated in a speculative light, den brysomme mannen makes normal human interaction look like deadpan comedy, as quotidian life becomes a performance, which transforms karl marx s meaning of the word alienation , because here, the men and women in the office, do identify with their labor, like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real. but the bothersome man never fully participates in the facade. he s always aware of the cracks. br br from a wooden bench, andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper, who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by, indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk. andreas faces the same impassivity from his own co workers after he purposely cuts off his own finger, with the hope that he ll feel the pain, on a paper slicer. he doesn t. it s just another sensation, in addition to being able to taste and smell that s lost to the bothersome man. this inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures, amplifies the bothersome man s need for love,where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. at a dinner party, hosted by his boss, andreas meets anne britt petonella barker . they hit it off. he walks her home. she invites him in. they become a couple. he moves in. when they have sex, however, it s good for neither andreas, nor anne, who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design. love is an abstract concept, another sensation that s unattainable in this world, but love matters to the bothersome man, so he tries again with ingeborg birgette lagen , a girl from work. den brysomme mannen deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman. when ingeborg doesn t elicit the same tender feelings for andreas after his hyper romantic gesture of leaving anne britt for her, this norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but odd city, with an open endedness that s solvable, and offer up multiple interpretations. br br wounded by ingeborg s apathy towards his avowal of love for her, the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station, stands at the same platform, leers at the same couple aggressively making out, and jumps. this time, he can t die. how can you die when you re already dead hit repeatedly by train after train, andreas face turns into ground beef his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art. when the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp, he seeks out the man from the club, who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead. which is death, not life, has no meaning. br br getting to the bottom of the mystery behind andreas whereabouts drives the narrative, and to the filmmaker s credit, this enigma is satisfactorily addressed, in a scene that recalls spike jonze s being john malkovich , when andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles the portal to malkovich s brain that craig schwartz charges people to crawl through. andreas attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox. since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that heaven is a place on earth . but at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of a hell the place that andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination.\n",

            "Review:  spoilers i sometimes wonder what makes sequel makers think that they have to explain and therefore destroy the mysteries behind iconic horror films. the original hellraiser of was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made. the sequel hellbound was also a fantastic horror film, though i personally didn t like how the viewer got background information on the cenobites, some of the all time creepiest horror villains in the original. the third part, hell on earth was already quite a mess, whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy lead cenobite pinhead a typical s stupidity and therefore destroyed most of his scariness. this fourth part hellraiser bloodline is slightly more atmospheric than the third one, but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary background information about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hell. br br seriously did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made i think not, and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film. the setting of bloodline goes back and forth in three different periods. the film begins in a nd century space station, when scientist dr. merchant bruce ramsay attempts to close the gates to hell forever. when government soldiers disrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons. in th century paris, merchant s ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult. an evoked demon, the princess of hell, took over the body of the beautiful angelique valentina vargas . since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it, the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages... the film, which takes place in the th century, the present, and the nd century, really is quite a mess. i admit that the part set in the th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film, but its also its smallest part. the parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak, and filled with stupid and unworthy elements. the film s undoubtedly strong points are the terrific make up and gore effects, the absolutely ravishing valentina varagas as the she demon, and pinhead doug bradley , who, in spite of having lost some of his creepiness, still is a menacing villain. it is an almost offensive idea for hellraiser fans, however, that pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous light show. overall, bloodline is not a complete disaster, but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly. even director kevin yagher was obviously embarrassed about it, as he preferred to be credited as alan smithee. overall, this is only recommendable to hardcore pinhead fanatics, and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demon s creepiness. all others are well advised to stick with the brilliant first, and excellent second part of the hellraiser franchise and skip all the others. the makeup effects in bloodline are creepy as hell, but almost everything else is disappointing. my rating . \n",

            "Review: i see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story, and i thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. the fact that they basically came up with excuses rewrites, budget constraints, production formats etc simply underlines how bad this movie is. and my criticisms in panning it are not personally directed but simply a warning that this one doesn t make the cut. br br it s watchable, but barely so. there are plot holes in every corner, the dialogue borders on the ridiculous, and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. the modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a recon team get drowned in silly dialogue like who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. would ya wrassle us up some hamburger helper sally, between us getting killed by these automated carpet sweepers apparently this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubed wonder armor has no access to mres. once they get into the last rooms they treat the place more like a four star motel than a deadly encounter zone. br br the rationale for the encounter with the fearsome rook is that it can t be killed single handedly. yet only one scene ago, the hero making that case abandoned king to do exactly that. huh vivian woo was attractive and hands down the best acted character in the movie. but that s not saying much.\n",

            "Review: this is just dreadful. i regret every second of the minutes i spent watching this dreck. i think it s supposed to be a comedy, but i don t remember laughing much, except at a few blatant inconsistencies and downright glaring errors. br br an unattractive middle aged man called lester meets up with rich unattractive middle aged women via lonely hearts ads, and then murders them for the money he needs to feed his gambling addiction. that s the whole plot, and that s really all that happens. along the way there is an attempt at intrigue when lester starts to get phone calls from a mysterious stranger who taunts him about knowing his secret, but its so badly implemented, you may not realise what is actually supposed to be happening. the sequences in which lester murders the rich widows are all quite brutal but also seemingly dressed up as comedies. one sequence has a woman bludgeoned with a wooden pole and then shoved into an oven. it s very cruelly depicted, but it is played out against blaring big band waltz music, with lester pulling faces and adopting comedy poses throughout. another scene has the victim murdered while she constantly sings shrill opera songs...you have to see this to believe it actually you don t have to see it at all, in fact i strongly recommend you avoid this flop. fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing and there s no evidence of any of the flair seen in his earlier career. one sequence stood out to me as particularly wretched the revelation when lester suddenly realises that he has no shadow. fulci seems unable to think up any visual representation of this phenomena on screen, so from this point on he just films the actor as normal, shadow and all and thus totally blows the whole angle. either he had zero budget for effects, or he just didn t care enough to think up any way of showing it. whatever it was, that should give you a taste of how lame this whole project is. i couldn t even understand most of the film, and there certainly wasn t anything on screen worth looking at half the time. even the ending was as flat as a pancake. a real dud.\n",

            "Review: gruveyman comment below you are a complete idiot...blinded by ignorance by the very city you have allegiance to. its that whiny arrogance, that you are ironically claiming the film exudes about sf, that makes you seem like such the typical la a hole the only reason you felt the film was so self congratulatory about sf is because you are jealous. of course you don t know it because you are so la jaded. first of all the film was completely factual about a beautiful city what has been filmed there and what has been filmed by some of its more famous locals. it says nothing bad about la and these accomplished directors choose to live in a beautiful city over la. they recognize that they went to film school in la and are obviously proud of that fact. they recognize that sf is close to la which is a benefit. the only negative thing that was said that relates to la, was about the studio executives. the same studio executives that hated these guys movies when they first saw them, but then those same movies went on to be huge world wide grossing films. so why wouldn t they have animosity towards the studio executive establishment and studio system these are the only people they are trying to disassociate from and for good reasons don t be so sensitive how can you say that francis ford coppola is the so called san francisco director how is he not to be considered that and who directed the godfather coppola did. it was his vision that told the story on the screen that won it a best picture award. so what who gave him the job he admits it in the documentary that he didn t even want to do the movie....so what s your point and so what if sophia wants to live in la and that proves your point how and tell me how they are not truly independent when they are funding a lot of their own movies. movies that are now considered classics. and, when they made movies from studio funding, one, it was la that came to them and said we want you to make these pictures and two, they used the money that they made from doing these pictures to fund their own. they said exactly that in the film. br br your bitchy and self congratulatory whining would take on an air of greater self respect and credence if you never set foot on the ground you so claim to be superior to in this film. br br how the hell can bitchy ness and self congratulation suddenly have an air of self respect and credence....if they never go to la again what a stupid and senseless comment you inserted some big words in there....and just don t know how to use them and, by the way, they never claimed nor implied they were superior to la so what if they are giving a guy from new york an award in la....again what the hell is your point so if they go to la or new york they are hypocrites by simply preferring to live in sf you make no sense. br br san francisco is proud of itself and its heritage and the people who make it what it is today. this film just focused on one aspect...film making. for you to take the time and type up such nasty comments about the city not the movie but the city and its people only proves what it is we northern californians hate about people from la this is a great documentary...very interesting, especially if you are from the bay area...but i recommend it to anyone.\n",

            "Review: an innocent man steve guttenberg has a one night stand with his boss s wife isabelle huppert . she spots a woman elizabeth mcgovern being attacked outside but she can t call the cops because it would blow her marriage to gutenberg s boss paul shenar . so guttenberg, honest citizen that he is, when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed nearby only half an hour later, comes forward and claims to have witnessed the first attack, merely intending to pass on the information given to him by huppert. well never bear false witness against thy neighbor, as they say. br br this simple attempt to help the police nab a murderer turns rapidly twisted. when he meets the first near victim, mcgovern, she immediately twigs to what happened, but agrees to keep quiet for the moment. but then guttenberg finds himself in court, supposed to identify the heavy greenquist and we discover through cross examination that he is near sighted and can t identify objects at a distance, let alone faces. not that it matters because, after all, he never saw the creep in the first place. the plot gets practically labyrinthine. guttenberg winds up the chief suspect when huppert is murdered too. br br he barely escapes arrest and holes up with the now sympathetic mcgovern. guttenberg and mcgovern hatch a plan to trap the murderer. she will serve as bait. they ll follow the flagitious creep into one of his seedy haunt and mcgovern will act like the doxy that the murderer is attracted to, just to get him to try to kill her. but everything will be okay, see, because not only will guttenberg keep a close watch on her, and not only will he alert the police a few minutes after she enters this dive, but she will keep a can of mace handy just in case. br br i ask you, the alert viewer, does this scenario unfold as planned elizabeth mcgovern has a quirkily interesting bone structure. she seems all mandible and tiny mouth at times, but she s vibrant. steve guttenberg has hair on his brawn and that s about it. otherwise he s as helpless as the character he plays. if isabelle huppert can act, it isn t evident in this film. the killer is so formed and so groomed that he looks like he s wearing one of those masks of deformity in that twilight zone episode about greedy heirs. br br didn t the director, curtis hanson, go on to make l.a. confidential that was a nicely done piece of work. here, everything seems clumsy and contrived, down to the small bit parts. just before the inevitable violent climax, a uniformed police officer is introduced to delay mcgovern s rescue, and the scene is embarrassing to watch. dick olsen has a bit part as a late shopper. he s a neat guy and always reliable. paul shenar as the cuckolded hubby has a striking face that seems made for the stage and he does a fine job too. br br that louche joint where mcgovern attracts the attention of the murderer, where she plays pool with a couple of hairy apes, was shot at a bar in carolina beach, in north carolina, not far from where i lived. the way the interior is set up, it s clear that this is supposed to be a dangerous and dirty dive. actually it appears rather more elegant on screen than it did in reality. br br overall, this is hitchcock territory and it brings tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story.\n",

            "Review: ordinarily, anthony mann made westerns with the big guys james stewart, gary cooper, henry fonda . . . the a list cowboy stars. but in this b film, he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western. the main character, played by victor mature, is a trapper mountain man, and ordinarily they are romanticized in films robert redford in jeremiah johnson, that sort of thing, where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men. not here. for once, a true mountain man vulgar, crude, animalistic is the central figure, and it s something to see, giving mature one of his better later roles. the real acting chops are provided by robert preston, excellent as a self absorbed custer type cavalry commander, and james whitmore, the poor man s spencer tracy, as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other. even more impressive is a very young anne bancroft as the officer s wife, who is initially repulsed by the very sight of mature s grisly character, then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize, to her own shock, that she s attracted to him. rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen, without the romantic allure that john ford gave such a place in his masterful fort apache. the battle sequences are big scale and notably violent, and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format. good show, and underrated movie, all around.\n",

            "Review: i used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters, but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap. if you look at promotional pictures posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging kissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime. this proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap. when i watch it i feel like i m watching a police version of coronation street or something similar. i have to say i still like the bill as i m interested in police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that the bill used to have. i want to rate it as out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over. br br as for the script and characters they have both gone downhill, most of the great characters are gone now although a few still remain i think and i m not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely aren t, its just that they lack the tough looks, personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble. br br overall being one of the only police programs on television these days, the bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch, but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness if thats the right spelling and would now be classed as a terrible, unreal television soap. br br recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved \n",

            "Review: secret sunshine is famous for its awards at the festival de cannes in and other film festivals. jeon do yeon, who played the newly widowed shin ae, won the best actress trophy at the th cannes festival. secret sunshine was also a winner of best feature film and jeon do yeon received a best actress nod from asia pacific screen awards. in addition, this movie won the best film awards in virtually all korean film festivals. masterfully written and directed, and uniquely photographed, secret sunshine expressed the hope and salvation that can be found when life is painful because of continuous tragedy. this film also talked about the forgiveness of god and people. lee chang dong, director and writer of this movie, said in an interview, in a vast sense, i wanted to express what love is and this movie could be a melodrama in a sense. without love, we can t talk about hope and salvation. lee acknowledged that secret sunshine had no apparent genre. this movie is not a movie about religion, but it drew attention from many christians in korea because there were a lot of christian elements in the movie. br br the turning point in secret sunshine comes when jun, shin ae s son, is kidnapped and killed. the kidnapper asks for money because he presumes that since she can buy land, she must be rich. her lie causes much sorrow. br br shin ae becomes a church goer and wants to forgive the murderer. she decides to visit her son s murderer in prison and forgive him. jong chan, shin ae s guy friend, says, just forgive in your heart. do you have to go to the prison her church fellows cheer for her and say they will pray for her. her pastor agrees with what she wants to do. that is a sad moment because it is too early for her to do an action. the result of the meeting with the murderer is another turning point in shin ae s life. the murderer says with a peaceful smile that he has already been forgiven by god. this sparks anger in her toward god. she says, how could you forgive the man before i forgive br br she begins to fight against god. she looks up to the sky and proclaims, i won t lose to you. she becomes a snare, her heart is a trap, and her hands are chains. it is more bitter than death. she becomes crazier and crazier and is sent to a mental hospital. on the day shin ae is discharged from the hospital, she goes to a beauty shop and sees a familiar face. the daughter of her son s murderer works in the shop and cuts her hair. the murderer s daughter has helped kidnapped shin ae s son. while she cuts shin ae s hair, the protagonist can t understand what s going on and gets out of the shop quickly. br br it is difficult not to talk about jong chan in the movie. jong chan does his best to be by shin ae s side. although shin ae doesn t care about him at all, he is beside her all the time. shin ae leaves church quickly, but jong chan, who started attending church because of shin ae, stays there because he feels peace with god. lee chang dong, the director of secret sunshine, says that jong chan is like milyang secret sunshine , the rural city or vice versa. he seems to be too secular and frivolous, but he is always two steps behind her and takes care of her. milyang is like him. mr. lee adds, someone joked that jong chan could be an angel. i think that he could be the angel. who knows we can t say for sure that there is no angel. if there is a person like jong chan who forever accompanies his lover s twists and turns, we can defend ourselves against the overpowered. the life of shin ae is full of meaninglessness. her husband died after he cheated on her, and her only son was killed cruelly by a murderer after she moved to her husband s hometown. and her soul was damaged because she learned christianity in a wrong that makes her crazy, literally. it is too easy to say that her life is filled with meaninglessness. does she still have hope in her life can she find meaning in her life the final scene gives us hope. shin ae tries to cut her hair by herself we walk our life s journey by ourselves. she, however, realizes that it is hard to do it by herself, and we know that we can t do everything by ourselves. we see jong chan holding the mirror for her while she cuts her hair. that s her hope. she has jong chan beside her and he is willing to help her in whatever situation she is. as i mentioned earlier, jong chan is like an angel for her. if we feel that an angel is always beside and behind us, we can find joy in life even though we face adversity in our lives. br br secret sunshine was a hot topic of conversation in korea. it is like da vinci code. while da vinci code helps us discuss the early church history, secret sunshine prompts us to deal with life s messiness and find meaning when life seems unbearable. with a shallow interpretation of the movie, people misunderstand christianity and its theology. with a deeper interpretation, this movie will help us see beneath the surface. some people say they quit attending church worship service after they watched secret sunshine, and lee chang dong responds by saying, they were already anti christ before they watched this movie. secret sunshine is a life story of a woman and we can interpret our life through shin ae s life.\n",

            "Review:  world s finest is an unique project. it s a trailer for a superman batman crossover movie that doesn t exists and will also never exists, at least not in this form, with these characters, actors and plot line anyway. br br so the movie is one big tease, even more than standards everyday real movie trailers. the trailer will hype you all up for nothing. in that regard, i really didn t liked this short project. when watching this trailer it makes you hungry and excited for more and at the same time sad and perhaps you ll even feel cheated afterward, when it turns out that a full length movie of this trailer will never exist at all. sort of makes you wonder why this project was made in the first place. surely to show off sandy collora s skills but couldn t he had also done this with a real movie short, like his earlier movie batman dead end . br br but when you have to judge this short purely for what it is, so from a movie technical point of view, it s a really great one. it s great looking and way more professional than you ll perhaps at first would expect, although the people who ve already seen batman dead end will already know better than to expect a short with cardboard sets, cheap homemade costumes and third rate actors. the short is not constantly impressive looking and obviously the budget wasn t sky high but for most part it s very impressive and professional looking, with nice costumes, sets, special effects, cinematography and lighting. br br the short has a good quick and typical trailer build up, with perhaps a bit too many posing shots too completely find it credible but hey, it works well for the trailer style. it has some impressive shots but also a couple of lame ones, mainly the superman flying sequences. it was obvious that the guy was just standing at a moving car, with a camera aimed at him from an angle below. i even found it a pretty laughable thing to watch. but really the better and more spectacular moments really compensate for this. br br michael o hearn seemed like a pretty good superman clark kent, although he obviously isn t the greatest talented actor around. clark bartram reprises his batman role well again and kurt carley seemed like an awesome lex luthor. the rest of the cast also served its purpose well enough. br br it s especially interesting to watch this short after the recent new modern reinterpretations of the two main superheroes of this movie, in the movies batman begins and superman returns . it s interesting to compare the style and character treatment of those movies with this one. it s actually amazing and fun to hear how much kurt carley does sound like kevin spacey, the actor who played lex luthor in superman returns . br br it s a good looking and well made and constructed trailer that however will makes you hungry for more, even though you know that there won t be more. whatever happened to the waner bros. plans to create an actual full length superman batman movie by the way i thought that developments were underway for it a couple of years ago but nothing has been heard of it ever since. instead two new separate batman and superman movies were made batman begins and superman returns . br br \n",

            "Review: intended as light entertainment, this film is indeed successful as such during its first half, but then succumbs to a rapidly foundering script that drops it down. harry judd nelson , a reformed burglar, and daphne gina gershon , an aspiring actress, are employed as live window mannequins at a department store where one evening they are late in leaving and are locked within, whereupon they witness, from their less than protective glass observation point, an apparent homicide occurring on the street. the ostensible murderer, miles raymond nick mancuso , a local sculptor, returns the following day to observe the mannequins since he realizes that they are the only possible witnesses to the prior night s violent event and, when one of the posing pair flinches , the fun begins. daphne and harry report their observations at a local police station, but when the detective taking a crime report remembers harry s criminal background, he becomes cynical. there are a great many ways in which a film can become hackneyed, and this one manages to utilize most of them, including an obligatory slow motion bedroom scene of passion. a low budget affair shot in vancouver, even police procedural aspects are displayed by rote. the always capable gershon tries to make something of her role, but mancuso is incredibly histrionic, bizarrely so, as he attacks his lines with an obvious loose rein. although the film sags into nonsense, cinematographer glen macpherson prefers to not follow suit, as he sets up with camera and lighting some splendidly realised compositions that a viewer may focus upon while ignoring plot holes and witless dialogue. a well crafted score, appropriately based upon the action, is contributed by hal beckett. the mentioned dialogue is initially somewhat fresh and delivered well in a bantering manner by nelson and gershon, but in a subsequent context of flawed continuity and logic, predictability takes over. the direction reflects a lack of original ideas or point of view, and post production flaws set the work back farther than should be expected for a basic thriller.\n",

            "Review: well it s not often that we in the uk have a film made about inner city life from the perspective of the afro caribbean community, the last example that i can remember was the underrated babylon way back in . so i had high expectations when i heard about bullet boy, a film that has been touted as the british version of la haine well la haine it is not i agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other british films of late, but my concern is that this film predictably ends sadly. br br the film intelligently deals with the escalating problem of black on black violence that is sadly all to common in london, but i m concerned that film makers now use type casting in plot as opposed to characters which is equally as damaging. saul dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that could be both entertaining and inspirational to us all, but sadly missed and created a film that only reinforces the idea that to be a young black male in london the only future is violence tragedy\n",

            "Review: i waited almost years to see this movie, thinking it might be an underrated work, from a period animation was no longer of the quality it had once been. it starred one of the best film villains of all time, was based on a beloved series of children s books, and was a disney studios production. what could possibly be wrong with it as it turns outs, almost everything. br br well, not everything. vincent price as rattigan and henry mancini s swanky score are the movie s two saving graces. price is wickedly enjoyable, and mancini more professional than the material deserves. they bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity. br br meanwhile the rest of the movie, while filled with inappropriately adult situations, still suffers from a completely dull script, blandly generic voice work, terrible songs, and lazy animation that wouldn t have been out of place on any of disney s mid s saturday morning tv shows. br br this was a complete disappointment to me. it s amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with the secret of nimh. costing a fraction of this, an independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than gmd has in its endless running time. br br the extra star that keeps this from being awful goes to price and mancini.\n",

            "Review: police story is one of jackie chan s classic films that helped shape the hong kong cinema. it is a masterpiece that should not be missed by any action movie fan. from the beginning it is obvious that jackie chan s stunt team literally risked their live to make this film. both the action and the stunts are extremely realistic and innovative. even today, no movie has outdone police story in dangerous stunts. many people were hospitalized in police story including jackie chan. the fighting is not as indisputably exceptional as the stunts but the fighting in this movie helped change and define jackie chan s use of props. throughout the film chan uses odd object to stop attackers and is constantly throwing assailants through thick glass. the action feels real because the stuntmen are giving the movie all they have to give and jackie chan s coordination is outstanding. br br the rest of the aspects of the film are not without flaws but they will not disappoint any action fan. chan not only plays a believable risk taking cop but shows the powerful changes that his character goes through as he falls into escalating desperation. the plot is powerful but a modern viewer may find it tedious at times. while the comedy will provide a good number of laughs it does not always distract the audience from the lack of action. however, for the time period it was made in, the driving aspects of the plot are entertaining. there a good number of interesting and well played characters dispersed throughout the film as well. br br overall police story is without a doubt one of the best action movies ever made. and even in hollywood the influences of this one film are not to be ignored.\n",

            "Review: i ve never been a huge fan of almodovar, but, generally, i ve always found something to enjoy in his films. unfortunately, i had more trouble finding something to enjoy in broken embraces then i would normally think i would. br br i find the biggest failure in broken embraces to be the characters and the lack of depth they display. the film is essentially a love story, one that is tragic, and one that wants to involve the viewer in their stories. i found this problematic from the beginning. br br in the opening scene, our hero the director screenwriter, mateo, is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met. his agent comes in as the woman bashfully leaves. br br in the opening scene, our hero the director screenwriter, mateo, is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met. his agent comes in, and rolls her eyes, as the woman bashfully leaves. mateo babbles something about needing to enjoy life as the only thing he has left. having been blinded in a tragic car accident that also killed his true love lena, played by penelope cruz, the viewer might buy into to this notion except the rest of the film really never illustrates why lena was the love of his life or any depth to his character or any other. br br cruz plays lena the mistress to an industrialist named ernesto martel. from the outset, their union is rather a pathetic one, as martel clutches jealousy to lena, and lena avoids uncertainty of being on her own by staying with the much older martel. to skip ahead, martel finances a film for mateo so he can keep tabs on the star of the film, lena. naturally, without any back story, lena and mateo fall in love. and, in almodovar s world it really is that simple. mateo, in the opening scene, has sex with a sexy young woman, now mateo falls in love with lena, later it s revealed he had a son with his agent after their love affair. her son responds to this information with a laugh and an, oh, well. again, no depth, no understanding for any of these characters, it all just happens. from the beginning of the film to the end, i got no depth of emotion from mateo. he is flat, and doesn t act much different from one scene to the next. br br the one scene i did enjoy was when film producer, martel, is watching video footage his son recorded under the guise of doing a documentary of mateo. there are nice a moment of martel watching obsessively as a lip reading confirms his worst fears. later, lena confronts martel as he s watching the footage and speaks her part out loud matching the video footage of her lips as she talks. some quite brilliant moments. rather contrived, but still really fascinating. br br unfortunately, for me, the rest of the film left me rather bored. i couldn t care about these characters or their situations, so no amount of cleverness on almodovar s part can make up for this lack of depth. i think if you re a fan of his work you ll enjoy this movie, but if you re like me, in between, then you ll find it lacking.\n",

            "Review: the day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of azumi s fate as an assassin, fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga. br br that s as poetical as i ll get when talking about azumi death or love, because when i cringed over the heavy sentimentality of house of flying daggers and complained about the credibility of aya ueto portraying a blood driven assassin, after watching azumi i started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before. br br not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience. in azumi we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics which is their number one priority as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape. but i won t hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in azumi s way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma. by the way, chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of go go, minus the cool weapon and sense of menace. br br this brings me to the final blow which is the action, simply disguised in the title as the death side of the epic. in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons. to no one s surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily. in azumi , the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fights in azumi was at least climaxed and worthwhile. some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter. i am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched. br br the romance side of azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution. br br as a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation, i won t lie and i ll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film, but i ll step right up and say that after watching azumi , the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece. for what it s worth, azumi death or love could have gone straight to video, with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins, doing their best to restore the peace, with an unwavering courage to die trying.\n",

            "Review: i m not sure this review contains spoilers, but i m playing it safe by indicating there might be. regardless, it s unlikely anyone will watch this film who isn t familiar with the book. br br there s an old wisecrack about laboring mightily and bringing forth a mouse. comanche moon is such a mouse. br br the novel focuses more on the indians than the americans. in adapting it for tv, mcmurtry and osanna rightly reasoned that the audience would be more interested in the whites than the reds. unfortunately, there s little in the novel that we don t already know about gus, woodrow, and their friends. so the movie gives us mostly a portentous prehash of what will occur in lonesome dove . the indians who have their own story to tell are largely relegated to the background so much so that someone who hasn t read the novel will rightly wonder why it s titled comanche moon . br br the novel has no overall story line, or much of a point . this could have been fixed in the movie, by more strongly drawing the contrast between the indians losing their lands and way of life to the encroaching americans, who bring civilzation . this opportunity was missed. br br unlike lonesome dove , comanche moon has few extended scenes that develop character or relationships at least among the americans. the extended scenes with the indians have been largely removed or shortened. and for a net four hour film, it is remarkably episodic and choppy. one gets the feeling the script was originally longer, and cut to reduce the production costs. br br the screenplay comprises mostly dialog, aphorisms, and platitudes. coming from the author of the last picture show , it s a startlingly bad script. mcmurtry and osanna had the opportunity to fix problems with the story and characterizations, but did not. br br some of the best dialog from the novel is missing or altered, for no obvious reason. for example, clara cassie shows her intense hatred of woodrow jack by condemning gus ennis for always running off to be with his pard . that tart little revelation of clara s sexual jealously is gone. then there s the scene where the ur dense woodrow warns maggie not to let jake spoon compromise her. the exchange in the novel is shorter and harsher the film tones it down, and doesn t portray woodrow as quite the socially stupid, emotionally frozen stone he is. when i read that scene in the novel, i wanted to punch woodrow in the stomach or worse. there are other changes, some of them understandable. inish scull s eyelids are not cut off to do so would like have required expensive cgi. but buffalo hump has no hump perhaps it was felt unreasonable to ask wes studi to schlep around such a huge prosthesis. and buffalo hump s character is kindler and gentler . he is nowhere nearly as grotesquely violent as he was in the novels. br br the only good thing about this near turkey is steve zahn s remarkable performance not so much as gus mccrae, but as robert duvall playing gus mccrae. it is uncanny. he perfectly duplicates duvall s mannerisms and manner of speech, without ever appearing deliberate or self conscious. as was duvall, he is wholly within the character. and he actually shows us gus becoming more gus in the third part. br br the best thing about comanche moon is that it won t spoil our affection for lonesome dove , not just a great western, but a great american film. br br ps for those who think rachel griffiths was over the top that s the way she was in the book.\n",

            "Review: dolph lundgren is back detention marks dolphs first film in nearly years, and that is following the delayed hidden agenda. this film still marks an improvement for dolph over his cheapie trilogy of jill rips, agent red and stormcatcher. however this film is well below the standard of hidden agenda, which was better in almost every respect. what this film does have in it s favour from dolph s previous outing, is a sense of cheesy fun. the film also has a rejuvenated dolph back in a high action role, and it s good to see dolph doing his own stunts again. br br the films story is ludicrous and prime b movie material. an ex military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching, whilst taking a detention class, he runs into some slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal. the film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches. if you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy. thankfully the filmmakers don t take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability, this film has a so bad it s enjoyable kind of vibe. br br where the film is let down is miss using a fairly decent budget. the budget of around million has not been well spent. it s all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination. the opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse. there are some good moments. you have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning, with plenty of destruction. the rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen. br br as for the cast. hidden agenda boasted the best cast dolph has worked with in ages. there was a good standard of actors for a dtv film. this however has problems. the actors are on the most part bad. the bad guys are terrible, but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because alex karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness. the teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters. they all hate authority, each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons, but generally they are decent and chris collins in particular has a likeability. this movie is all about dolph though. while this film is nowhere near his best, it is nowhere near his worst. it also marks a turning point in his career. he is now back in good shape, and will be in even better shape in his next film direct action. dolph looks enthusiastic here, he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man running from explosions in slow mo, one liners, and handling large weapons again in a movie like his older ones, albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like army of one. it is good to see dolph looking energised. his films of the last or so years have seen dolph looking a little more weary, and using doubles a lot he still does all the fights himself though but the new streamlined dolph seems up for it. br br overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and dolph in prime action man mode. there s not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm. \n",

            "Review: this fantasy was utter garbage. i thought michael moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti government movies, but this one was far worse than anything he ever did. no wonder critics of the british media complain it s driven by tabloid journalism. this movie is a left wing loony s greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen. anyone even slightly to the right of such rabid bush bashers should be appalled it ever got funding to be made. i m sure it will do well in syria, iran, pakistan, and north korea, though. it s hard to believe that in these days of insane muslims blowing up innocent commuters there is anyone in the u.k. who thinks britain should surrender in the war on terrorism. i guess it s no longer the country i admired for standing alone against the nazis nearly years ago. all hail neville chamberlain and the pathetic policy of appeasement \n",

            "Review: another end of the world film that begs comparison to the abysmal day after tomorrow . following the same sort of structure as dat but with a distinctly japanese style. how does it fare that depends on your taste for japanese melodrama. br br i found that the small human touches to be what makes this film compelling for most of it s hours. also the frequent title cards explaining some of the science. the effects are probably the best i ve seen in a japanese film and they compare very well to anything out of hollywood. many of the disaster scenes are truly horrifying even though the human carnage is usually off screen. and that is one of the drawbacks. while the terror of thousands of on screen deaths like in the recent war of the worlds might have too overwhelming, we also don t really get a sense of the chaos of an entire nation crumbling into the ocean. a few scenes touch on the chaos but for the most part this part of the story is barely touched on. regardless, this film works on a lot of levels and is way more realistic then dat, that is until the end. br br unfortunately the story hinges itself on one plot device and another plot device that would be at home in the s japanese earth in peril film gorath . after the reasonably good science and mostly realistic take on the disaster, this makes for a bit of disappointment. the sudden stopping of the film for a pop love song doesn t help either unless you like the song . this made the exciting ending a bit of a drag for me. br br the overall direction is good and the art design is excellent. acting is all good as well. recommended.\n",

            "Review: with a title borrowed from werner herzog and liberal helpings of kubrick, haneke and noe it is painfully obvious that thomas clay considers himself a cut above the usual sort of rubbish our british cinema churns out. robert carmichael for short sets itself up as a realistic study of youthful alienation and at the same time seemingly a critique of the iraq war. the problem with the realism is that the characters are so patently unrealistic and atypical contrary to the fetid imaginings of extreme filmmakers most teenagers are not drug addled rapists. as a critique of the iraq war, a film about youth violence by a talented classical musician subtext society has damaged this sensitive individual is so infantile as to hardly bear thinking about. there are signs of technical ability but some reviewers have overstated this. like kubrick and noe he does show that the desire to shock linked with supposed serious intent may be the worst cinematic con trick of recent film. people liked clockwork orange and irreversible because they liked the rapes and the violence, but most of all they liked feeling culturally superior for liking things that most hated. so too much kubrick and not enough haneke a serious and moral filmmaker here labels this as one of the most moronic films in years. i am not against violence in film. to do it seriously is a hard trick though people in cinemas cheered alex in clockwork orange showing how kubrick s supposed intent was missed by miles. gratuitous violence is much easier to achieve and is less offensive than the pretensions of many art film directors. \n",

            "Review: when you see this movie you begin to realise what a drastically under utilised asset the late dudley moore was. there should be a dozen movies like this in our archive. br br he was already top notch talent before he went to hollywood, both as a comedian and a musician. but mostly he is remembered for his pairing with peter cook, on television and in one or two indifferent british movies. perhaps the best of these was bedazzled . br br he always tended to be eclipsed by cook, who s jealousy and meanness rifted their partnership and enabled moore to realise his true potential in america. arthur is the result. br br this is a truly splendid movie. moore s clownish comedy as a drunkard is undeniable. the script is perfectly suited to his manner with lot s of hilarious, almost surreal conversational digressions. there is something so british about him that i m actually surprised he found such an appeal to american tastes. tommy cooper, an anarchic comedian after the same fashion tended to draw a blank. it is moore s almost childish vulnerability that is so endearing. br br liza minelli and john guilgud tend to play straight roles against him, but still have some excellent one liners. john guilgud in particular delivers his with a sarcastic and acerbic authority that is a treasure to watch. he invariably steals any scene in which he features and thoroughly deserved his oscar. correct me if i m wrong, but he has never played any other comic role. br br there is a follow up movie called arthur on the rocks . it never attains the same sublime levels of fun that this one reaches, but it is still rather good even so. guilgud only gets a cameo appearance at the beginning and as a ghost. it is darker. and there is some interesting soul searching. it will disappoint if you watch arthur first. br br hollywood seemed to loose interest in cuddly dudley after these two outings. he eventually returned to britain, dejected and apparently dying. br br but arthur is a sample of what might have been. we can only imagine the other great movies he should have made. br br your re sadly missed, dudley.\n",

            "Review: the main problem with the documentary czech dream is that isn t really saying what it thinks it s saying. br br in an audacious i hesitate to use the word inspired act of street theater, vit klusak and filip remunda, two student filmmakers from the czech republic, pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie they deliberately fabricated a phony hypermarket the eastern european equivalent of costco or wal mart super store , built an entire ad campaign around it replete with billboards, radio and tv spots, an official logo, a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise and then waited around to see just how many dopes would show up to their creation on opening day. they even built a makeshift to convince people that the store itself actually existed. br br one might well ask, why do such a thing well, that s a very good question, but the answer the filmmakers provide isn t all that satisfying a one. essentially, we re told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something even something that s not true simply through the power of advertising. and the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the real i.e. higher purpose for the charade is to convince the czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the european union. fair enough especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers, all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of research into what does and does not work in advertising. in a way, by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments, these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the ruse. br br but, in many ways, the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target, it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it. for it is they themselves and not the good hearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here, as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people, some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot. and what is all this supposed to prove anyway that people are greedy because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains or that they re stupid and gullible because they don t suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world. br br no, i m afraid this smart alecky, nasty little stunt only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots. and, indeed many of them, when they finally discover the trick that s been played on them, react with a graciousness and good humor i m not sure i would be able to muster were i to find myself in their position. br br i m not saying that the movie isn t gripping something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action but, when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red faced and empty handed to their homes, we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed.\n",

            "Review: awful awful awful no, i didn t like it. it was obvious what the intent of the film was to track the wheeling and dealing of the movers and shakers who produce a film. in some cases, these are people who represent themselves as other than what they are. i didn t need a film to tell me how shallow some of the people in the film industry are. i suppose i m at fault really because i expected something like roman holiday . br br i m not a movie maker nor do i take film classes but it appeared to me that the film consisted of a series of two shots in the main where the actors had been supplied with a loose plot line and they were to improvise the dialogue. henry jaglon makes the claim that he along with victoria foyt actually wrote the screenplay but the impression was that the actors, cognisant of the general direction of the film, extemporised the dialogue and it was not always successful. such a case in point was when ron silver made some remark which really didn t flow along the line of the conversation and i m not going back to look for it and greta scacchi broke into laughter even though they were supposed to be having a serious conversation, because silver s remark was such a non sequitur. you get the impression too that one actor deliberately tries to wrong foot the other actor and break his her concentration. another instance of this is when a producer tells silver to bring the documents times . silver looked literally lost for words. i have seen one other film which looked like a series of drama workshops on improvisation and that was awful too br br the fact that jaglon was able to attract greta scacchi no stranger to australia , ron silver, anouk ami, and maximilian schell suggests it was a slow news week for them. peter bogdanovich had a what the hell am i doing here look on his face at all times and i expected to hear him say look, i m a director and screenwriter not an actor which would have been unnecessary to state faye dunaway seemed more interested in promoting her son, liam. apart from the jerky delivery of the dialogue, the hand held camera became irritating even if it was for verisimilitude as i suspect the natural dialogue was and the interest in the principals became subsumed to the interest in the various youths walking along the strand trying to insinuate themselves into shot. that at least approached cinema verite. so that, along with the irritating french singing during which i used the mute button, made for a generally disappointing odd minutes. br br i think we should avoid apotheosising films such as this. trying to see value in the film where it has little credit in order to substantiate a perceived transcendental level to it is misguided. there was really nothing avant garde about it. it didn t come across as a work of art and yet it wasn t a documentary either. i know, it was a mocumentary but the real test is whether it is entertaining. i was bored out of my skull it did have one redeeming feature it pronounced cannes correctly so i gave it .\n",

            "Review: i thought this was a very daring representation of the old hokey tarzan concept made so popular by hollywood, weismuller, et al. br br yes there is a lot of silly stuff. but then, the idea is silly. it is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees. i am tempted to say completely unbelievable, but that the concept has never been tried. and there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort. though under the circumstances i can see how that would be very difficult to avoid. we also now have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation, and know that a human raised from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them in adulthood. br br still, if you can get your head around that lot, there s a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring. lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb. i am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play. there are plenty of other excellent performances too. not least of which are sir ralph richardson and ian holm. br br what is particularly disturbing and rightly so is the simian perception of humans. we get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor, dumb, helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it. and it demonstrates well how the phony civilisation and morality with which we cloak and justify our conduct, is no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance. it may seem a little overstated at times, especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms, but what we see isn t just a truth about the victorians its a truth about the way we are today. it s one that needs to be stated, and cannot be stated often enough. holm s character s obsession with the ray zor as a symptom of civilisation as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned is an excellent case in point. primitive bearded readers take note. br br the story is depressing. ultimately it s a tragedy. because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral tyranny that is truly human civilisation we know he s doomed. before the third millennium is years old, wild simians will be hunted into extinction as bush meat, and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify insatiable human excess. br br in the end, it s a tale about ourselves. the path to extinction that other simians tread, must eventually be followed by humans. br br highly recommended for its ethical take, despite the hokey moments.\n",

            "Review: this is easily the best cinematic version of william faulkner s fiction that i ve ever seen, and i ve seen several of the most prominent ones. filmed in faulkner s hometown of oxford, mississippi, it really captures the feeling of jefferson and yoknapatawpha county. intruder in the dust is not one of faulkner s best novel, but, even if it is a to say this, it would be the crown jewel in any one else s career. it beats harper lee s good but simplistic to kill a mockingbird fifty feet into the ground i read that one in ninth grade, and that s exactly where it belongs . two of faulkner s most prominent characters play major parts in the film, gavin stevens and lucas beauchamp. stevens is probably the single most common character in all of faulkner s fiction. he s a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator, because, unlike many of his other characters, stevens is a man of logic, not emotion at least when he s older . lucas beauchamp may be the most prominent of all of faulkner s black characters he plays a major part in one of faulkner s out and out masterpieces, go down, moses unlike all of the other black folks in yoknapatawpha, he refuses to bow down to any white man. he has pride, and many in the white population find that an execrable quality in a black man. one day, lucas is found standing over a dead white man with a recently fired pistol in his possession. most of jefferson and the surrounding areas don t see the need for a trial, and everyone s pretty sure that beauchamp will be lynched before the evening s over, or at least the next day, as the murder and arrest occurred on a sunday. beauchamp, on the other hand, declares his innocence and tries to get stevens to help him. stevens refuses the case seems open and shut. but his young nephew, chick mallison, because lucas had helped him in the past, is willing to help him now. br br as far as i know, no hollywood film of this period deals with racism as overtly as this one. hollywood films rarely persecute the black population, but instead prefer to relegate them to servant roles. if you re an african american actor, you might as well give up and accept that role as either the mammy, the maid, the servant, or the porter, because that s the only way you ll work. in intruder in the dust, there is to be found one of the most memorable non porter roles a black actor ever had, lucas beauchamp. and beauchamp, as i described above, is no stereotypical character, and might have been hard for audiences to accept. even today, black characters are usually simple, magical, and kind. the recent arthouse hit far from heaven is a great example of that. beauchamp is kind of a jerk, and he s very stubborn. although he s perhaps a little less so here than he is in the novel, he s not any kind of stereotype. he s a complex human being. juano hernandez plays beauchamp extraordinarily well. i haven t seen the film in a while, but he also appears in robert aldrich s film, kiss me deadly, as well as the cinematic adaptation of faulkner s final novel, the reivers. br br all the actors are great in the film. i should also praise quickly claude jarman jr., who has the great role of chick mallison. the novel takes place from his point of view, and he is the conventional hero of the picture. jarman is quite an actor he captures the character who also appears elsewhere in faulkner s fiction, narrating, for example, events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the novel the town perfectly. he would appear in another great role the next year in the underrated john ford film rio grande. the only other film of clarence brown s that i ve seen is national velvet, quite a different picture than intruder in the dust. his job here is exceptional i really have to credit him with capturing faulkner perfectly. other famous faulkner adaptations are too melodramatic the long hot summer, filmed in , which i really like despite that or too cold tomorrow, filmed in , which i do not like that coldness is a complete misunderstanding of faulkner . the only other one that really does well according to its source material is douglas sirk s great filming of pylon really a different sort of faulkner novel altogether , tarnished angels. .\n",

            "Review: although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere, and some okay shots that might harken some back to the silence of the lambs days, the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere. br br the film is about erroll babbage gere who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire. his office thrusts upon him his replacement, allison lowry claire danes, stardust , who quickly discovers that babbage is obsessed with his job. and that job ain t very fun. he monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction. allison goes with erroll on many calls to check up on his flock of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement. but erroll is good at his job even if his methods aren t. he taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them. erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants pasts. it is this good justification that challenges the audience on some level, letting us see how brutal erroll is and yet how out of touch he s become by being too close to his job . br br when a teenage girl goes missing in erroll s area , he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock. but how could he know is erroll that good at his job allison challenges him and erroll pushes back. their battles become as fierce as erroll s need to find this missing girl. br br although the set up for the story was okay, it didn t have any umpf i will give credit to richard gere, however, who plays the erroll character very well. battling retirement. worried about everyone who s near his flock. disgusted with those he s responsible for overseeing. disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does. quite a change in character portrayal for gere. but beyond him there s not much else. some of the sets are okay dark and dangerous but there are so many other problems as to be laughable. br br i ll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films. but that suspension has limits. the biggest push against those limits is the destruction of extremely vital crime scenes. someone as meticulous as erroll would know that moving a body would be a huge no no. or trampling through a crime scene. or moving evidence. it went beyond and hurt the film to no end. br br the other damaging part of this film is that we never get into clair danes character, allison. she s almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and we re never privy to what her intension might be will she stay or leave will she end up like erroll if she does stay this isn t a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground, but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up.\n",

            "Review: the original vanishing point was a great flick. subtle motives, characters that seemed real and spontaneous.the remake was terrible. preachy, overtly obvious it missed the point as to why the original was a classic. the black charger was cool, but even that couldn t rescue this flick. why stick with a white challenger i didn t think that was the best choice back in . some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious. like when vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his dream quest . his indian pal was standing next to him. vigo was only wearing his white briefs. i m sorry it just looked silly him surveying the vista in his fruit of the looms. another scene was at the end after the explosive crash into the bulldosers the announcer said that the impact was clocked at mph. then he mentions that the cops said his remains weren t found because he vaporized, but some people believe he bailed out and was hidden by friends in the crowd. then it shows him rolling out of the car at mph first of all, you couldn t open the car door at mph. secondly, the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for yds. with nobody to steer it. it would promptly roll over about times. thirdly, if you hit the pavement at mph, you would wind up in various squishy pieces. no matter, we see him at the end standing with his daughter. all in all, a movie that would insult anyone s intelligence.\n",

            "Review:  beyond rangoon is simply marvelous. from the traumatic opening to the uplifting ending, you will be amazed at how well put together this film is. patricia arquette amazingly portrays laura bowman, who we meet as a shut down and quit despondent young doctor, unable to deal with her grief over the loss of her husband and son. throughout the course of the film, as she is trapped in burma, witnesses the democratic uprise and massacres in the capital city of rangoon, flees for her life, and saves her tour guide s u aung ko s life, she is regaining her will to live. this may seen contrived or heavy handed it is not. john boorman, a master at spiritual and emotional conflict, paints the film with broad strokes, and often uses symbolism to capture laura s emotional state, and physical predicament. patricia arquette, as usual, gives a wonderfully convincingly and believable performance as the emotionally wounded laura. what arquette does amazingly, in any role that she plays, is give us a window into her character s heart without words. every time she is given a close up in the film, the audience is given insight into her character. she does not need to speak to convey emotions, or be over the top. some critics were harsh on arquette s performance in the film when it opened on august , , deeming that she was flat or dull in the role. i found her characterization dead on, staying well away from the melodramatics that typically are part of an actor s performance when having a personally tragedy take place. she is on shock and is reserved about her feelings that is just as normal as screaming lashing out at those around you. i am hoping that warner brothers releases this title on dvd very soon. with arquette s hugely successful nbc drama medium bringing her to household name status, not to mention an emmy win and now nomination, it would be in the studio s best interest to do so. hopefully there will be extras, with the alternate ending. do not by pass by this film. it is one that you will certainly not forget after seeing.\n",

            "Review: wow, what s this on the video rental store s shelf in front of me nothing other than a questionable sequel to mm. it wasn t a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie. br br basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an american diplomat, david huxley, and his tish harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in budapest, hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, risa. the entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city. the mystery is solved when, in the end, tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and essentially later on in the story her which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end. br br i didn t like how this had nothing to do with the original mm at all. the only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that david ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene. otherwise, its a totally different movie. it made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because i didn t believe the words coming out of david s mouth the whole time. but we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble. br br there were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the shocking moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this hellish sex debauchery. i counted at least ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown. even the menu screen on the dvd is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the dvd seem totally provocative. br br david was no heroic person throughout the film. you could guess he was the main problem long before the end. the actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting respect. there were plot holes how did david and richard finally impress tish s father by getting the lease they wanted when david was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute there were cheesy technology moments like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen , and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a joaquin phoenix knockoff to play this character. the tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete bs, too, because it wasn t even about a last breath. nobody really dies. but they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good seconds long out of an hour and long movie. br br go rent and maybe buy the original. it s one of joel schumacher s better and more original films. it has everything better about it from this film. i wouldn t recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.\n",

            "Review: going down as the most expensive film in finnish history, to date, dark floors is a horror film with an extremely lynchian narrative that recounts an ever increasingly decrepit series of floors ironically enough in an abandoned hospital, in which our protagonists are trapped. lead by an autistic daughter and her father, himself disenchanted with the hospitals apparent lack of medical progress with his daughter, make their way into an elevator debating the issue with one of the hospitals nurses. accompanied by a security guard, a businessman and a seemingly intoxicated tramp the collective soon find the complex abandoned, but they are not alone. directed by finnish born pete riski, more known for his television work, dark floors is filmed in english, using mainly english actors but has the notable inclusion of finland s arguably most famous group lordi eurovision song contest winners as themselves, i.e. in their on stage monstrous costumes, as the films antagonists, yet for all this razzmatazz the production fails where it is needed most, in convincing the audience. br br any film that has their lead character use the phrase it s too quiet is already headed down a dubious path, and this lordi influenced horror does not break that convention. for all the good ideas that are thrown into the mix there are a handful of ripe alongside and worst of all, anything that is interestingly original isn t fleshed out enough for it to resonate. the concept of the degrading floors is initially highly ominous and does provide a sense of inevitable doom as the audience is aware those trapped in the hospital must progress ever further down in the mire. however, there isn t enough atmosphere created to scare and intimidate the audiences into the unknowing fear, the viewer is aware the journey will become ever more dangerous, as the levels degenerate from shiny white through to hellish black, but i don t think the characters are aware enough of this fact for it to be threatening. also, the entire film taking place in what is essentially its own time bubble is again a very nice touch, a concept not often used in the horror genre, but the characters don t confront the situation with enough fear and trepidation when they stumble across this fact, they continue about their business far too readily and without enough genuine concern for the idea to mean anything to the audience. these initially good ideas are just left to go to waste, as if the director and or mr lordi who had many of the ideas used within the film had these thoughts, but couldn t agree or decide on how to best use them and as such lose their purpose and point. br br yet for all the frustration there are large quantities of comedy, yet not for the reasons the creators would have hoped for. too much is too much is recycled and too much is just simply ridiculous. while the lead is amicably acted by noah huntley, the characters are mere cardboard cut outs that have been pasted into the story from other films. we have a lead man doing everything possible to protect his daughter alongside a clunkily developed love interest. accompanying the couple we have the traditional token black man as a hard nosed security guard, with the nigh on infinite clip for his sidearm, and a weasely disbelieving businessman only on the look out for himself. worst of all though, unfortunately, is the introduction of the cast of lordi as the creatures of the night that torment our wandering band of misfits, but not for them appearing as themselves. what makes a horror film scary to the viewing audience is contextualising the fear. the shining is scary because it s a member of your own family hounding you, in dawn of the dead it s our fear of each other and the primordial cannibalism and irrational thought patterns the zombies possess, in alien the fear is explained, the creature is rationalised and in dark floors there is none of that. perhaps it s unfair to compare this production to these monoliths of the genre but when you do it shows it pales significantly and that it s aggressors feel like nothing more than demented klingons where you can almost see the zip on the costumes they wear, without a build up of any atmosphere lordi just aren t scary. br br it s infuriating because we all cheer for the underdog and hope they do well, you want the smaller productions to say that they can create the same quality of film as hollywood churns out, much in the similar way that george a romero started out, but it doesn t always materialise. i enjoyed the film and didn t feel as if i had wasted the ninety minutes i had just sat through, but i felt enjoyment on a completely hollow level as if nothing that had occurred mattered or affected me subconsciously, emotionally or critically. i felt the almost lynchian narrative was a standout plus point, but it fades out into nothingness. why did it happen what does it mean will they go through this all again without even the slightest insight into what will happen the film is simply puzzling for the sake of trying to be arty. was the entire sequence of events real or was it merely a dream sequence had the autistic girl watched the eurovision song contest of and simply had a highly bizarre nightmare given the stress she was under who knows and unfortunately i fail to work up the energy to even care. dark floors is an infuriating experience that while ultimately shallow hallmarks potential and at the very least shows a plethora of creative energies from mr lordi, who perhaps should look into working solo to fully develop his ideas. it s one that fans of the group or the genre should perhaps pursue but will leave you feeling left in the lurch for not having enough light shed on the situation.\n",

            "Review: horror gods boris karloff and bela lugosi should be more than sufficient a reason for any genre lover to watch a film, and, even though the most convincing one they are not the only reason to watch this particular little sci fi horror gem. while lambert hillyer s the invisible ray of does not nearly share the brilliance of other contemporary films starring karloff frankenstein, bride of frankenstein , the mummy ,... or lugosi white zombie , island of the lost souls , dracula ,... , or both the black cat , the raven ,... , this is doubtlessly a highly entertaining film that no lover of cult cinema should consider missing. compared to other universal horror pictures, the storyline seems a bit silly, but in a delightful manner. karloff and lugosi, of course, shine as always, and the film furthermore profits from great sceneries and an excellent photography. karloff plays dr. janos rukh, a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a telescope, and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago. stunned by rukh s invention, the celebrated french scientist dr. felix benet bela lugosi , invites him to join an expedition in to find the meteor. in africa, rukh makes a discovery that is capable of causing great beneficence and great destruction alike... it is somewhat odd that karloff, who was in fact british, plays a hungarian scientist here while lugosi, who was hungarian, plays a french scientist, but they are both excellent as usual. as far as i am concerned, these two horror deities could have probably been filmed reading the telephone directory, and i am sure they would have made something out of it either man is an icon of the horror genre, and seeing them together is a treat for every fan of the genre. by the way, this is one of the few films, if not the only one, in which it is obvious that lugosi was actually taller than karloff. frances drake makes a very good female lead in her role of dr rukh s beautiful young wife. the rest of the performances are also good, if not particularly worth mentioning. other than the casting of karloff and lugosi, the film s greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography, as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline. my main complaint is that i would have wished for more screen time for lugosi, and for his role to have a bit more significance. he is fantastic as always, but his role could have been bigger, and more sinister. otherwise, the invisible ray is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic horror sci fi cinema, and a must see for all my fellow lugosi karloff fans.\n",

            "Review: what makes for best picture material the oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly, and ignoring the auteurs who would be deified in decades to come. it wasn t because hollywood was against art or creativity. the academy awards are the selections made by the industry itself, and that is why, at least in the classic era, they tended to reward the greatest collaborations, the most sensational meetings of creative minds. br br the arthur freed unit at mgm had been bound for oscar winning glory for several years by this point it was only a matter of time before freed, aided by his strongest director vincente minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business, would land a best picture. freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else, crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the s musicals. the point about freed musicals, is that the lyrics of the songs, unlike those of hammerstein or lerner, don t have to tell or even relate to the stories. what s important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film. br br an american in paris was the first of three freed musicals the other two being singin in the rain and the band wagon which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story. the words don t fit the plot, but the routines fit the show. so, when gene kelly sings i got rhythm, he hasn t even got a girl yet, but the way it s done with the french kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation, and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point. an american in paris also uses the rule breaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story, such as the series of dances which accompany the description of leslie caron s character. br br and what better director for this project than minnelli, himself a painter and a pianist at this time there wasn t really anyone who had a better feel for technicolor. while some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades, minnelli s colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced. in the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted, but not drab, and in particular there is an absence of red. during oscar levant and georges guetary s meeting in the a few more vibrant shades are introduced. then, during the first musical number, by strauss minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red a table cloth, a bunch of roses until it eventually dominates, as if the song has awoken the picture s colour scheme. for most of the songs, the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people. however, in some numbers, such as tra la la he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animated. br br the achilles heel of an american in paris is its story. i personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable, playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the s the headstrong, independent woman gets rejected while the meek, delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero. even if you don t mind that, it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances. compare this to singin in the rain, which doesn t really have as many great routines or memorable set pieces as an american in paris, but it has a winning storyline. singin in the rain was overlooked at the oscars, yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today. but i think people sometimes forget that cinema is an all encompassing form of visual entertainment, not just a means of telling a story. an american in paris is not deep or engaging or tear jerking but, like a certain demille picture that won the top award the following year, it certainly is a great show.\n",

            "Review:  seed is torture porn...no doubt about it. but, strangely, uwe boll has written, produced, and directed a more polished film than any other he has made in recent memory. br br every time i watch a boll film, i feel that some pages of the script must have gone missing. there are simply huge gaps in the story and dialogue. of course, nothing makes much sense, either. the films are somewhat surreal in this respect. br br spoilers br br why do the six cops who go to arrest seed split up and go their separate ways when they get to the darkened residence, unlike real cops who would enter and clear the house in pairs or by threes why don t the cops ever use their radios how can the bodies decay so quickly, a process that would normally take many months i know it s time lapse photography...but seed would never be able to stay on schedule killing people if he always waited around for the previous victim to decay to the point shown. how come seed gets to wear bib overalls and a mask while he s waiting on death row instead of typical prison uniforms how can seed enter a maximum security prison, stroll around the cell block, and then walk out again without being stopped or even noticed if nearly people according to some newspaper articles shown in the movie have been murdered, why is there only one investigator working on the case why did the investigator suddenly decide that he should go look for seed at seed s house, where he was originally arrested and where he murdered his victims didn t he think of doing this sooner why does the police detective go it solo, without back up and without even letting dispatch know what he was doing and where he was headed br br this is particularly frustrating when boll obviously goes far out of his way to make sure we understand why the electric chair fails to work properly. he spends several screen minutes in setting this up, when he could have spent them making other aspects of the film at least a bit more logical. br br end spoilers br br in short, the film just sort of serves as a framework for a few assorted scenes perhaps boll would think of these as his visions of a brutal death by bludgeoning, gunshots to the head, execution by electrocution, and the skinning of live animals raised for their pelts. the opening scenes of animals being skinned were indeed unnecessary and disturbing, but i understand their purpose in the context of the film. the centerpiece is undoubtedly the bludgeoning death of a middle aged woman by seed using a hatchet. it s obvious that much time was spent on this and it vaguely reminds me of the classic scene in reservoir dogs , though without the steely dan soundtrack. br br is this a good movie no. is it worth seeing only if you are a dedicated fan of the torture porn genre or if you are absolutely determined to see a sample of torture porn. as i said at the start of this review, even though this movie is pretty disgusting and can be sickening at points, it is truly much more competent than most of boll s movies. perhaps he will continue to improve as a filmmaker. i can only hope that he progresses beyond torture porn and continues more in the vein of postal .\n",

            "Review: i caught this cuban film at at an arthouse film club. it was shown shortly after the magisterial silly symphony cartoon where the isle of symphony is reconciled with the isle of jazz. what with the recently deceased ruben gonzalez piped through speakers in this old cinema ballroom and a cuban flag hanging from peeling stucco rocaille motifs, the scene was set for a riproaring celebration of engaged filmmaking and synchronised hissing at the idiocies of helms burton. but then the film started. and the cinema s peeling paint gradually became more interesting than the shoddy mess on screen. br br the storyline of nada mas promises much. carla is a bored envelope stamper at a cuban post office. her only escape from an altogether humdrum existence is to purloin letters and rewrite them, transforming basic interpersonal grunts into outbursts of breathless emotion. cue numerous shots of photogenic cubans gushing with joy, grief, pity, terror and the like. br br the problem is that the simplicity of the narrative is marred by endless excursions into film school artiness, latino caricature, marx brothers slapstick and even during a particularly underwhelming editing trick the celluloid scratching of a schoolkid defacement onto a character s face. br br unidimensional characters abound. cunda, the boss at the post office, is a humourless dominatrix nosferatu. her boss eyed accomplice, concha, variously points fingers, eavesdrops and screeches. cesar, the metalhead dolt and romantic interest, reveals hidden writing talent when carla departs for miami. a chase scene in oh so hilarious fast forward is thrown in for good measure. all this would be fine in a mortadello and filemon comic strip, but in a black and white zero fx flick with highbrow pretensions, ahem. br br nada mas attempts to straddle the stile somewhere between the quirky heroine matchmakes strangers of amelie and the poetry as great redeemer theme of il postino. like amelie, its protagonist is an eccentric single white female who combats impending spinsterdom by trying to bring magic into the lives of strangers. and like il postino, the film does not flinch from sustained recitals of poetry and a postman on a bicycle takes a romantic lead. unfortunately, nada mas fails to capture the lushness and transcendence of either film. br br there are two things that might merit watching this film in a late night tv stupor. the first is the opening overhead shot of carla on a checker tiled floor, which cuts to the crossword puzzle she is working on. the second is to see nada mas as a cautionary example our post buena vista social club obsession with cuban artistic output can often blinker us into accepting any dross that features a bongo on the soundtrack. this film should not have merited a global release films such as waiting list and guantanamera cover similar thematic territory far more successfully.\n",

            "Review: the man in the white suit, like i m all right jack, takes a dim view of both labor and capital. alec guinness is a scientific genius but an eccentric one he has never gotten his university degree due to an...err...accident in a college laboratory . he manages to push himself into various industrial labs in the textile industry. when the film begins he is in michael gough s company, and gough in a memorable moment is trying to impress his would be father in law cecil parker by showing him the ship shape firm he runs. while having lunch with parker and parker s daughter joan greenwood , gough gets a message regarding some problems about the lab s unexpectedly large budget problems. he reads the huge expenditures due to guinness s experiments , and chokes on his coffee. br br guinness goes on to work at parker s firm, and repeats the same tricks he did with gough but parker discovers it too. greenwood has discovered what guinness is working on, and convinces parker to continue the experiments but now legally . the result guinness and his assistant has apparently figured out how to make an artificial fiber that can constantly change the electronic bonds within it s molecular structure so that for all intents and purposes the fiber will remain in tact for good. any textile made from it will never fade, get dirty, or wear out it will last forever. br br guinness has support from a female shop steward, but not her chief. he sees guinness as selling out to the rich. but when he explains to them what he s done, they turn against him. if everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes soon parkers fellow textile tycoons led by gough, ernest theisinger in a wonderful performance, and howard marion crawford are equally panic stricken by what may end their businesses. they seek to suppress the invention. with only greenwood in his corner although parker sort of sympathizes with him , guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the public. br br in the end, guinness is defeated by science as well as greed. but he ends the film seeing the error in his calculations, and we guess that one day he may still pull off his discovery after all. br br it s a brilliant comedy. but is the argument for suppression valid at one point the difficulties of making the textile are shown you have to heat the threads to a high temperature to actually enable the ends of the material to be united. there is nothing that shows the cloth will stretch if the owner gets fat or contract if the owner gets thin . are we to believe that people only would want one set of clothing for ever what happened to fashion changes and new styles and the cloth is only made in the color white making guinness look like a white knight . we are told that color dye would have to be added earlier in the process. wouldn t that have an effect on the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the textile br br alas this is not a science paper, but a film about the hypocrisies of labor and capital in modern industry. as such it is brilliant. but those questions i mention keep bothering me about the validity of suppressing guinness invention\n",

            "Review: with few exceptions, most of george bernard shaw s plays have virtually disappeared from the theater these days. too arch, too talky appears to be the general verdict. this bbc version of one of shaw s funniest plays doesn t refute that verdict. it is certainly arch and talky, but it is also wonderful. and because of the quality of british theater, it is perfectly cast with actors whom with the exception of helena bonham carter most of us have probably never heard of. carter is splendid as the bulgarian girl who shelters the professional chocolate soldier pip torrens and later falls in love with him. one might quarrel with the especially ridiculous interpretation of sergius patrick ryecart , the bulgarian cavalry officer who led the charge into the enemy s lines and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for its machine guns. however, the role invites over acting and ryecart was obviously told to over act. the other players are letter perfect. carter as the self dramatizing bulgarian aristocrat and torrens as the swiss soldier of fortune are at the play s center, of course, and they are wonderful. yes, arms and the man comes across as a filmed play. but you re unlikely ever to see a shaw film that doesn t betray its origin. the plots are generally clever. however, shaw is all about the dialog. the action is minimal even in st. joan and the sets are immaterial. enjoy this for what it is.\n",

            "Review: bell witch haunting aka the haunt is an american horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period to . br br this is not to be confused with bell witch the movie, a movie starring betsy palmer based on the same events. however, i can say that i wish i had seen this other movie instead of the one i saw i enjoyed betsy palmer s chilling performance in friday the th. as such, i believe that even on a bad day, she d pull off a better performance than anyone involved in the travesty known as the haunt. br br with regard to my heading, this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing. it is painful to watch because it is just downright boring. br br reading the positive reviews for this movie, i could only identify three possibilities. the first possibility these authors were involved in the production in some way. the second possibility the authors whilst not directly involved were paid to write positive reviews after production was completed. the final possibility none of these authors has seen a sufficient number of horror movies and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts utilise. br br the setting for the plot is robertson county, tennessee. james johnston receives a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of the bell witch. the story is told as a series of flashbacks. a series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of john bell and his family. it soon transpires that a vengeful spirit is behind it all. br br on the surface the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist affair, albeit one based on real events. br br where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however, just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong. and then some br br first, the acting. the acting is almost uniformly terrible right across the board. this factor does the most damage to the production, undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer. the voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent. i almost laughed when i heard some of her lines. unfortunately, this voice began to become very annoying very quickly i may not have been alive in the s, but i find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this ghost does br br second, the direction. the direction is haphazard and very uneven. some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director. nothing is done with the camera, with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary. the atmosphere is equally flat. a vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural occurrences. yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them. i ll give one example. in one scene, the spirit attacks someone. see the scene for yourself. it s almost funny almost. br br third, the script. whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story. this movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story. whilst this style was also the case with british movies from the british horror heyday of the s and s, it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works. peter cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers. the same cannot be said of the actors in the haunt. br br finally, the humour. the ill guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating. an obese boy is the butt of many jokes. one particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet. this scene should never have been included but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what he is doing br br the only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes. the decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity. the costumes were also well chosen. br br overall, the haunt is an appalling movie. it is not even in the so bad it s good league. it is instead just boring. i advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. don t even bother seeing it for free br br i have never seen the other movie about the bell witch. but it really couldn t be any worse than the haunt. could it i ll give this other movie a chance if i can track it down. br br in the meantime, i would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting. the legend of hell house, the changeling, ringu, the grudge japanese original and one missed call japanese original are good places to start.\n",

            "Review: there are so many reasons as to why i rate the sopranos so highly, one of its biggest triumphs being the cast and character building. each character unfolds more and more each series. also each series has an array of different small time characters as well as the main. a good example of a character who was only in three episodes who you can feel for is david the compulsive gambler played brilliantly by robert patrick. every little detail builds the perfect tv series. the show revolves round mob boss tony soprano james gandolfini who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two. the show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable. whilst tony runs things with capos paulie tony sirico and silvio steve van zant his nephew christopher michael imperioli looks for a promotion. every episode also features tony s other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano edie falco . on top of these problems is his uncle junior soprano dominic chianese is trying to get what he can out of tony s businesses despite being under house arrest. all the acting is powerful and characters complex, but the two who stand out the most are james gandolfini who is tony soprano. also michael imperioli who plays christopher, representing the younger generation in crime. if david chase had not created this masterpiece modern tv dramas of such caliber may not have existed, such as the wire and dexter. so the sopranos is definitely the godfather, goodfellas and pulp fiction of tv\n",

            "Review: it s almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of three colors red without letting people in on some of the ideas that krysztoff kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy. the more i see them and think of them, and imagine myself in their world, the more i get its theme that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves, and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion. in blue, juliette binoche played a grieving widow whose plan to live her life without connections to the past had her meet someone unexpected. in white, an act of cruelty spawns an unlikely friendship between two men who will, against the odds, conspire to bring the perpetrator to justice and full circle. and now, in red, all the elements of fate and apparent coincidence apply themselves into the meeting of a young genevese model and a retired judge who has a habit of prying into other people s lives. br br this young girl is appropriately named valentine a luminous irene jacob , who has this radiance about her and even smiles openly while working the runway. not that she is without some baggage she has a boyfriend, unseen, who also demands to know what she is doing at all times, she has a brother who troubles her, and she rejects the advances of a photographer who is working on her image for a huge billboard. she strikes a dog while driving and nurses her back to health, but when she takes her to the owner, a retired judge jean louis trintingnant , he does not want her. i want nothing, he coldly says, and elements of blue suddenly reveal themselves as this arrogant man, who also lives in anonymity and apparent, free floating freedom, conducts surveillance on unsuspecting people. this male version of juliette binoche s character at first shocks valentine she states she can only feel pity for him as she walks away in horror, but a chance event has her back at his place, and here is when he begins revealing who he is, and his great loss. br br at the same time kieszlowski is unfolding a parallel story the story of a young man, auguste jean pierre lorit , about to become a judge and who lives right across the street from valentine but they keep missing each other. chance is the word. like valentine winning the jackpot at the grocery story she visits, elements of chance pepper her life and auguste s. he has a girlfriend who also supplies people with telephoned reports about the weather. one of them happens to be the old judge. he knows more about her than auguste does, and he s never met her. like god, or prospero, he is slowly creating a storm which will crack the walls of this present state of conformity and bring a new meaning to the expression we meet again. it s this parallelism between the old and young judge that makes red so beautiful and transcendent, because time is, in reality, a lot more fluid than we would like to deem it. there are people whom we meet in life that if only we had been born in similar time frames, so many things would be different. br br such is the case with valentine and the old judge. i believe that there is definitely a strong fraternity of souls tying them together in a tight bond she is that woman whom he did not meet by chance or not and is, whether he knows it or not, trying to make amends, hence why he goes to the great risk of revealing his surveillance and becoming the social outcast. but it doesn t end there. one of the many links between the three movies is the character of an old woman walking to a large garbage container. where julie did not see her and would not have helped her anyhow , and karol fresh from his public humiliation sneers at her thinking, someone is worse off than i am, valentine is the one who helps her. frailty in need can happen anywhere, and kieszlowski even applies it here in a minor character. br br now, red is so much more than a story. valentine, the old judge, auguste, even rita the dog these aren t characters confined by storytelling. an american version would ruin the idea and commercialize chance encounters and even bring forth a dumbed down ending. red is so devoid of a linear, defined plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the possibilities that this story could have veered off in so many directions had one crucial element not taken place at the exact moment and place. br br adding to the concept of characters who mirror each other despite time frames or location is the theme of sexual betrayal. this is also an important and character defining element in all of the three films in blue, julie s husband had a mistress and she also betrays olivier when it s become clear she s emotionally dead. in white, dominique has karol listen to her moan over the phone which becomes an important device in red as she has sex with a man while the billboard of brigite bardot s contempt looks on. in red, the old judge s tale of love and betrayal gets re enacted. and all this time, valentine s billboard image looms over them like a presage of what is to come at the same time that rita, the dog valentine s car struck, bears seven pups, life renewed for the six major players in this complex trilogy obviously filmed with care and love. why do i say six you ll have to watch the movie and wonder.\n",

            "Review: it s interesting that all who so far seemed to like this film had no expectations i guess that s the trick. in contrast with them, i had optimistic expectations, and that was a mistake. as soon as i saw how close to the faces the camera always was, i knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director that s always a clear sign of them, they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors. the actors in this film, though, had only one facial expression each. br br if the close camera wasn t enough, the lack of light in the film killed it. the film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark. so now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur, as well. ooh ooh, we re going to light the set with a flashlight that will make it all seem intimate no, that made it all seem invisible. br br on top of the serious technical flaws, there was absolutely no story beyond the barest hint of an idea that was never developed, and nothing new about this kind of relationship was illuminated. perhaps this is a new kind of film for germany, but in los angeles, forget about it. br br the fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards doesn t indicate the quality of the film, but besmirches the quality of these particular festivals. i can assure you that this film won t win anything in the festival where i saw it. in fact, two times during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave this was one of the side effects of the cinematographer s total darkness technique . but when the film shuddered on, instead, there were moans coming from the audience. and once the movie finally did end, it was clear that it hadn t mattered if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier points. an earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scenes of domesticity folding sheets, cutting vegetables, spreading honey on bread . yeah, we get it, the life of the lonely old man was boring but we figured that one out at the very beginning. br br i recommend that audiences miss this one, it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie goers.\n",

            "Review: black snake moan is uproarious. it is over flowingly rich, fantastically orchestrated, strange and cumbersome, unique and visionary. in continuation of hustle flow, brewer paints his portrait of the american south almost as a mythological land one would expect to see in a fantasy or ancient greece epic. and yet as far high above us his movies hover, they are still rooted rooted in the deepest, darkest soil there is. br br as in traditional fairy tales, brewer paints his portrait in black snake moan using extremes and exaggerations. sharp and stark character traits, when coupled with such extreme acts as chaining a half naked white girl to a radiator in an attempt to redeem her of her sins, exaggerate and emphasize the metaphor the same way such extreme visual techniques such as some characters having colour in pleasantville strengthened the metaphor in that fairy tale film. but brewer doesn t begin his film with once upon a time in this film and also in hustle flow, brewer presents us with a different fairy tale a dark, gothic fable of sex, prostitution, and ultimately, redemption. these themes run through the film s veins like blood and resonate and bloom in its dark, brooding setting. br br but despite these harsh extremes, brewer treats his characters like humans, and creates extremely well executed, three dimensional characterizations in lazarus and rae, particularly emphasized with their relationships with lazerus friend at the pharmacy, angela, and rae s mother. br br the acting is, all around, quite perfect. one gets the feeling that both christina ricci and samuel l. jackson were born to play these roles. their characterizations are so intense and so severe it s even more of a challenge for the actors to keep their heads on and craft realistic characters. and they succeed admirably. samuel l. jackson in particular utterly disappears into his character, which serves as a polar opposite to most of the character s he s played before. with films like pulp fiction, jackie brown, shaft, and others, he has crafted for himself a typecast of the ultimate bad ass . in black snake moan jackson plays an old, broken, defeated and earthy character quite unlike anything he s done before. and frankly, it s just fantastic. what comes as quite a surprise, though, is the casting of justin timberlake, and more specifically, the fact that he comes across as quite tolerable. sure he doesn t have much screen time, but like what brewer did with ludicrous in hustle flow, he actually gets timberlake to act and do what he is meant to do, and not come across as totally unconvincing and irritating. br br but what is really so incredibly great about the movie is the atmosphere brewer creates. the rural southern locations work to his advantage in creating a dark, dirty, grimy, crusty, rugged kind of texture to the entire film, which more than fits in with the film s thematic and metaphorical aspects. and by utilizing all sorts of elements such as the rising sound of cicadas when rae gets her itch, or a raging thunderstorm that increases and intensifies as lazarus plays his black snake moan blues number for rae, brewer truly manages to create almost a fantasy world, an undermined mythology to the rural southern setting. and it works so utterly fantastically to craft brewer s unique vision. br br and one can t talk about a craig brewer film without mentioning the music. in hustle flow, he utilized a soundtrack of down and dirty, street wise hip hop music to emphasize the atmosphere and the vision. in this film, the music works even better at polishing off and fully representing the unique atmosphere. it is a rural blues soundtrack, but it s the dirtiest, rawest, grittiest blues you ve ever heard. and it sounds just absolutely fantastic. br br in all, it can be said that had this movie been a simple tale of an old, broken, lonely, god fearing black blues singer redeeming a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffers from nymphomania, there may have not been very much to write home about. but this film is not about the plot, and not even about the characters, as well as they are crafted in the film regardless. no, this film is about the vision and what a unique vision it is it is about the atmosphere, the mythology, the setting. it is about anger, fear, redemption, and most importantly, the blues. and it s all wrapped up in a unique, entertaining, stylized and impeccable ribbon. brewer has guaranteed himself a spot on the most promising up and coming directors list, and with such a solid follow up to a great debut film, hustle flow, he will definitely be on my radar for future projects. br br it also must be mentioned that the film has one of the most fantastic and unique titles i ve heard yet.\n",

            "Review: i had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel...so invariably my expectations were crushed. but they were crushed more than should be expected. the movie would have been a decent movie if i had not read the novel beforehand, which perhaps ruined it for me. br br in any event, for some reason they changed the labor camp at toulon to a ship full of galley slaves. the scene at bishop myriel s was fine. in fact, other than the galleys, things survived up until the dismissal of fantine. because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman, she does not cut her hair, sell her teeth, or become a prostitute. the worst she does is run into the mayor s office and spit on his face. bamatabois is entirely eliminated. because having children out of wedlock should also not be talked about, tholomyes is fantine s dead husband, rather than an irresponsible dandy. valjean is able to fetch cosette for fantine before the champmathieu affair, so they reunite happily, yet another change. then comes the convent, which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up. thankfully, it was saved. after this three minutes of accuracy, however, the movie again begins to hurtle towards classic novel butchering. br br as cosette and valjean are riding through the park, they come across marius giving a speech at a meeting. about prison reform. when he comes to hand out fliers to valjean and cosette, he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the tv set. we aren t revolutionaries. i could hear victor hugo thrashing in his grave. of course they are revolutionaries they want to revolt against the pseudo monarchy that is in place in favor of another republic, you dumb screenwriters it s a historical fact that there was an insurrection against the government in . br br at one point cosette goes to give marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets eponine. except...not eponine. or at least not the eponine of the book. this eponine appears to be a well to do secretary girl working for the prison reformers who are working out of the cafe universal as opposed to the cafe musain . not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her not period, low cut, tight fitting dress and her snooty mannerisms. br br the prison reformers lead by the most poorly cast enjolras that i have ever seen decide that handing out pamphlets isn t good enough anymore. so they re going to build barricades. i don t know about you, but i have never heard of reform movements tearing up the streets and building barricades and attacking government troops. about three hundred people it was not supposed to be so many start attacking the national guard and building a bunch of barricades, etc. eponine does die for marius, thankfully. br br the rest of the movie is sort of accurate, except that javert s suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation. the movie ends with valjean watching javert jump into the river. this is again inaccurate because valjean would never have let javert drown. he saved the man s life earlier, why let him die now then there s the whole skipping of valjean s confession to marius, his deterioration, and his redemption on his deathbed with marius and cosette by his side. br br overall, i can blame the script mostly for the problems. while i am glad enjolras and eponine were at least present in the film, they were terribly misinterpreted, as was the entire barricade scene. the elimination of fantine s suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her. that cosette knows valjean s past from the start messes with the plot a good deal. i did not even see thenardier, and mme. thenardier only had a few seconds of screen time. the same with gavroche. i did like frederich march s interpretation of valjean a lot, however, which was one of the redeeming features of the movie. on the other hand, charles laughton, for all his great acting in other movies, seems to have missed the mark with javert. the lip tremble, the unnecessary shouting, and his acting in general all just felt very wrong. he also, like many javerts i have seen, did not appear at all menacing, something required of the character. br br again, this film would probably feel much better if i had not read the book. i would not recommend it to book purists, though. i would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate french version come out the year before.\n",

            "Review: i m a big fan of surrealist art, but this film by bunuel with some ideas from dali left me cold. bunuel had a life long grudge against the catholic church and delighted in trying to offend catholics in fairly silly ways. this is one of the silliest almost like what you d expect from a smart aleck year old in film class. the last few minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final nose thumbing at religion. br br if you read the scholars regarding this slow paced, occasionally amusing film, it s all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. if that is indeed the point, then bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible. the central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street, and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies. is this behavior the church s fault for interrupting his lovemaking , or is he just a jerk i vote for the latter. i think bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the catholics as the ones to blame. br br there are a few moments where you might cry, aha surrealism a cow in a bed, a giraffe falling out a window a poor model , a man shredding a feather pillow, a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava or a mud pit...hard to tell in b w . the rest is forgettable self indulgence. unfortunately, bunuel was still chasing the same bogey men through the rest of his career viridiana, discreet charm... . if you re interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, check out jean cocteau s early work.\n",

            "Review: this film is probably the best new french film i ve seen in this century so far. there have been some great ones including noe s irreversible, green s le pont des arts and hadzihalilovic s innocencebut none of them come close to les amants reguliers timeless glory. br br the movie is a description of the events of may and what followed in the wake of it and furthermore it is and update of, and a homage to, the nouvelle vague movies of those days. concerning the depiction of the riots in paris the movie is meticulously accurate i m only and i wasn t there myself but you know what i mean and the almost real time and very long riot scenes set the stage perfectly for the aftermath of the events in the streets of paris. the riots are not glorified or beautifully photographed like the ones in bertolucci s the dreamers to which the movie is comparable in many ways instead they are filmed in grimy black and white shots courtesy of the excellent william lubtchansky. the love story that is the movie s main concern after the riots in is filmed in stunning and far less blurred shots and manages to evoke true feelings of love and adolescent confusion in the midst of the otherwise politically concerned and seemingly cold environment. br br this film is a beautiful love story and it radiates through it that the director wants to depict his own experiences of those mythical late s which makes the film all the more compelling. but the film is also a homage to the whole nouvelle vague canon. much of the dialogue evokes early truffaut, and the length and non action and plot less structure is reminiscent of eustache or rivette. there are even godard like verfremdung effects with the persons looking directly into the camera and even addressing bernardo bertolucci directly. this film is no doubt an answer song to bertolucci s the dreamers and it is also a nouvelle vague homage but still it stands by itself as a beautiful and radiant love story. br br bottom line this movie is incredible and if you love french cinema you shouldn t sleep on it. it may be the finest french film since eustache s la mamain et la putain.\n",

            "Review: i ve been scolded and scorned by fellow christians for stating my disappointment with this movie. i get hounded by statements like these i can t believe you didn t like it it was made totally by christians everyone donated their time and no one was paid for the movie it was made by a church and not hollywood. we should spend our money on movies like this they only used , to make the film. this is by a real church and christian school in georgia a preacher wrote and directed it. so, apparently, the reason i should love this movie is simply because of the way it was made and the minimum amount of money used to make it and that is was made by christians. that is all that is needed for me to love the movie. br br look, i got the movie without knowing anything about the background of the film. i had never heard of it and had no idea other than football what it was about. i watched it like i watch any other movie and was disappointed. i was disappointed in the lousy editing and lame script. i was very disappointed on the resolution after the climax. don t worry. there have been other cheap movies and other expensively made movies that have earned less respect from me. it isn t about the making of the movie. it is the end product. br br the writer acknowledges that god doesn t say yes to everything we pray for in the way we want, but he wanted to show by having faith, god changes our lives. that is true. however, god can change our lives and we re still infertile. god can change our lives and we don t get a raise from our job. god can change our lives and our car is still an old jalopy. god can change our lives and our house is still stinky. why didn t he portray that in the movie others voiced their concern to the writer director over the matter, but apparently, he was defensive. br br i did not think the acting was horrible nor many of the landscape shots. i like the idea of going to god and recognizing his awesome power and our weakness. br br the writing and directing were very weak. it is easy to distinguish this because many of the characters have no development. all we really get from the coach s wife is she is not pregnant well, until the end of the movie . it seems as if there was only ball player that had the potential to have an interesting character and that was chopped to bits into i have a cripple father and i can t play football well, but i ll kick the winning field goal even though i ve never kicked a real field goal before. another problem was the christian school itself. umm, i have worked for two christian schools, went to one myself, and have had many nieces and nephews in other christian schools. all in all, i ve had some pretty close connections with about ten different ones. none of the problems that i have seen in all of these schools were addressed. i saw this as totally surreal in the movie about their school and wished they had shown the human factor. it would have been nice to see a dose of reality and how god can work. br br i will close by stating that every work either written or drawn or played on an instrument shares the artist s world view. the world view that was shown to me in this movie consists of people who pray the right way win ball games, get new cars, conceive when they couldn t, get a raise, and get their house fixed all within a short time span. i know. i should love the movie simply due to the sincerity of the people who made it. i think i should love the movie because it was well done and for no other reason.\n",

            "Review:  spoilers spoilers br br this movie, the divers , is really interesting. all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history, underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish. but i decided to check it out for one reason, the fact that the story evolves around a sunken wwii german submarine. i ve got a fetish for german subs, especially wrecks that can be dived upon. so i was a bit sceptical about the danish part, but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part. knowing that nordic films aren t always that good and not sure of the budget size i was, to say the least, very sceptical. br br upon viewing i was ... surprised. br br i had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate, seeing how some are very young, the two main actors in particular. this was not an issue, they both perform very well. as do the other actors, who mostly consist of people in their s and beyond. this makes for some interesting interaction between young and old, not often seen on the screen. not unique in anyway, but somewhat rare. and it s all good. br br as for the danish language, it is nearly impossible to understand. but this was no problem, it had subtitles. br br another issue was the submarine itself, i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine. having decided their budget was slim, i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at it s worst. again i was surprised, the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. having a fetish for german subs, i knew what the sub should look like, especially inside, and was not let down. the team has done some serious research. it s all good. br br i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a warning . the submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war. it s a special purpose sub. but to give you a hint of what to expect, it s a crossing between a type vii, type ix and a japanese transport sub similar to i . it s god a good design and makes a nice wreck. br br the setting is on a danish island or peninsula, i can t remember. it s summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year. their grandfather is a mariner of sorts. the cinematography is quite nice, a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks, some newfound teenage love, nice diving weather and a general feeling of perfect . once again, it s all good. br br plot wise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind, a gathering of men hire one of the boats, an old minesweeper and it s crew. one of the visitors, a man in his s, has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back. the island s senior citizens all remember when a german u boat was sunk towards the end of world war ii and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths. the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken u boat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in . no submarine was ever found. br br what to expect br br key elements are nazi experiments, nazi history, treasure hunting, secrecy, competition, teen love, conspiracy, and ...a surprise. br br warning spoiler br br i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard. not being a big fan of supernatural events, it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no problem. it s not like from dusk til dawn where everybody turns into vampires towards the end. this is a bit more subtle. br br overall really good movie, i gave it an . some due to the fact that it isn t a hollywood movie with unlimited resources. i later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned danish veterans. but even if this had been a hollywood production, i would give it a or . definately worth your while. yes, a child s story in a way, but then again a mature tale. it has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure, which i found very appealing. and, again, the cinematography is really nice. br br medusa br br \n",

            "Review: less a thriller than an colorful adventure with suspenseful elements, the man who knew too much should not be really be compared with such hitchcock masterpieces as vertigo, rear window, or psycho it is instead more akin to such enjoyable romps as to catch a thief and north by northwest. shot largely on location in morocco and london, the film tells the story of a married couple james stewart and doris day whose holiday is interrupted when they innocently run afoul of an assassination plot and when their young son is kidnapped in order to insure their silence. br br james stewart and doris day are quite effective in their roles of the all american couple, and the characters are given an unusual twist stewart, a midwestern doctor, is outgoing but has a touch of the ugly american abroad about his personality day, who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired upon her marriage, has a suspicious nature. these qualities of personality and background play extremely well into the story. br br the man who knew too much contains a number of famous scenes both the scene in which stewart drugs day before telling her of the kidnapping and the very complex albert hall sequence, involving what seems hundreds of cuts, are very powerful. less often noticed, although to my mind equally if not more satisfactory, are the more subtle scenes in which hitchcock combines an edge of suspense along with perverse humor, as when stewart attempts some detecting at a taxidermist shop and day belts out que sera, sera written for this film in a most unsuitable way at an embassy cocktail party. br br although the man who knew too much lacks the depth and impact of hitchcock s greater work, it remains an enjoyable film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole. it s hitchcock light, but recommended. br br gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer\n",

            "Review: i am fully aware there is no statistical data that readily supports the correlation between video games and real life violence. the movie is false and phony because it is in complete contradiction of itself, which is what i tried to emphasize in my original review. the movie fails, not necessarily because i really do think these kids were influenced by video games, but because the movie sets it up as random and doesn t follow through. let me clarify. in aileen life and death of a serial killer, you can see her claims about the police and being controlled by radio waves are ridiculous, yet she is so troubled, she really believes them to be true. the viewer can make the distinction however. in zero day, the kids keep saying how they are not influenced by anything environmental, which is obviously false since everything they do contradicts this. neo nazism, talking about going on cnn with wolf blitzer which is laughable not only because they know his name, but its a shameless attempt by the filmmaker to get coverage of his bad movie ..etc. this movie doesn t depict reality , it shows nothing but phoniness to prove a point. unfortunately you fell for the bait and didn t see this, and you didn t pick up on it from my review either. the entire movie is just taking michael moore s hypothesis and applying it to something real life in hopes of validating and it fails, not necessarily because the hypothesis is wrong, but because the movie is wrong and doesn t support it. of course i don t think kids that play video games are more likely to kill people, but if i m not mistaken, didn t video tape exist of the columbine kids or some teen killers shooting guns in the forest claiming how much they looked or acted like the weaponry in doom hmmmmmmm, the distinction is kids are most likely aware of the media, influenced, but obviously balanced or intelligent enough that its not even an issue. zero day is a bad movie not because i really believe a correlation exists, but because the film maker doesn t know what hes trying to say, and the movie does more to disprove his point then support it. it s almost as if the new ratings given to video games made someone upset so they came up with zero day in retaliation. if you want to see the mindless teen killer theory pulled off right, go watch bully.\n",

            "Review:  flavia, la monaca muslmana aka. flavia the heretic of is a truly disturbing and uncompromising piece of italian exploitation cinema that, to a certain extent, follows a somewhat feminist premise though the level of sleaze and brutality would probably disgust the majority of feminists . set mostly in a convent, and with a nun as the eponymous central protagonist great performance by the wonderful florinda bolkan , flavia the heretic may be referred to as a nunsploitation film. however, this film differs quite drastically from the typical nunsploitation flicks from the time, as it doesn t so much focus on the nunsploitation elements such as lesbianism, sadistic lesbian punishments, etc. personally, i saw more similarities to the hexploitation flicks of the time, such as mark of the devil , even though this one doesn t treat the topic of witch hunts , which focus on the brutal execution of christian fundamentalism in the middle ages and early modern period. br br italy around after witnessing her despotic father behead a wounded muslim soldier, young flavia is forced to become a nun in a convent. when her father condemns a fellow nun to a torturous death for a small misdemeanor years later, falvia s disgust with male violence against women turns into hatred against the despotic church, and she joins a band of arabic scavengers... br br one thing is for sure, flavia the heretic is not for the faint hearted, and neither is it for those who want happy endings. director gianfranco mingozzi obviously tried to make his film as realistic and disturbing as possible, especially in its nasty scenes. the many torture and execution scenes are extremely disturbing, with skinnings, spikings and other gruesome scenes in explicit detail, the most shocking scene probably being the torture of the young nun quite in the beginning of the film. the violence here is never superfluous, however. after all, this gruesome methods actually were reality in the time the film is set in. the film is very well made, with realistic costumes, fantastic settings an elegant cinematography and a great score by nicola piovani. the stunningly beautiful and great florinda bolkan has proved her talent in many great italian cult productions including lucio fulci s giallo masterpiece non si sevizia un paperino of . she delivers another great, charismatic performance here, and i couldn t imagine another actress fitting as well in the role as she does. the film has some minor inconsistencies e.g. why does the rigid church let bizarre cult followers into convents in the first place . however, it is overall amazing how realistic this film is. flavia the heretic should definitely not be missed by my fellow fans of italian exploitation cinema. this is a great exploitation flick overall, though it definitely is a deeply depressing one and therefore should be watched in the right mood. highly recommended to fans of disturbing exploitation cinema. . \n",

            "Review: the young dr. fanshawe mark letheren , an avid archaeologist, is dispatched by his museum boss to the large country home of squire richards pip torrens , where his task is to find provenance for and catalogue the collection of antiquities and curios belonging to the recently deceased father of the squire. the squire is surprised by the arrival fanshawe, he hadn t been expecting him for another week, but none the less welcomes him and gets his only servant, patten david burke..of dr watson fame , to show him to his room, as fanshawe must stay over for some days in order to finish his rather large task. patten it would seem is not the friendliest sort and seems to resent the extra work that fanshawe s visit will entail, the large empty house providing an endless amount of cooking, cleaning and maintenance for him. fanshawe is a fussy sort, very neat and precise with everything having its place, whether they be his clothes or his books and papers and he is rather disgusted by the dirt in his room. needless to say he is rather eager to begin his work, but unpacking he finds his binoculars have been damaged in transit, so he asks the squire for a replacement pair, the squire who is a modern thinking man but also it would seem rather uncultured with such matters, is also eager to get rid of the clutter around the house, so he obliges and walks fanshawe to the top of the hill so that he can survey the estate and the surrounding villages, there the squire directs him to points of interest, including gallows hill, where locals were hung for their crimes and misdemeanours, his interest is also taken by a local abbey which the squire describes as a ruin, but fanshawe can see through the binoculars that it clearly isn t, he investigates further and pays a visit to the site of the abbey and is shocked to find that there are but a few stone remnants fanshawe doesn t have too much time to think about this conundrum as he darkness falls he feels he is being watched, he feels a presence, he begins to see moving shadows in the woods, startled he runs home. over dinner he imparts details of his harrowing day to the squire, patten overhears the story and suggests an explanation for it..the binoculars they used to belong to a local man called baxter, whom it would seem collected bones and skulls from gallows hill, boiling them up for some concoction or other, baxter had disappeared mysteriously one night, the late squire had acquired his belongings, including a mask made out of a skull and some old etchings of the area. these etchings fascinate fanshawe as they portray the abbey he seen through his binoculars, but he learns that the abbey had been destroyed during the reign of henry vii and so it would be impossible for baxter to have drawn the sketches, never the less they are signed and dated by baxter to the recent past so he concludes that the binoculars have some special power. that night he has horrifically vivid dreams, when he wakes, he sets off with the binoculars to have a closer look at the abbey through them, what he finds surprises him but has he put himself in perilous danger by doing so fanshawe finally becomes trapped in his dangerous obsession, as darkness falls the squire and a search party go in search of the now missing archaeologist, they are alerted by dozens of loudly cawing crows circling above gallows hill, they quicken their speed, but will they be in time to help or save fanshawe from his destiny the ghost story for christmas series of films made by the bbc sadly ended its initial run of films in with the ice house, they were for the most part based on the work of the great m.r. james. in and the series was revived briefly and thankfully a view from a hill also marked a return to the work of james, whose ghostly writings have haunted many generations of readers. director luke watson being new to the series might have worried fans of the older films, but he returns to the period setting abandoned by the later films which immediately sets the tone for a great ghost story, his direction is assured as he stays true to the mood of the masters works and gradually builds up the fear factor to a terrifying climax, all the while keeping what the viewer sees to a minimum, thus upping the tension and mystery. the autumn countryside provides oodles of atmosphere, the falling leaves and low lying sun providing an unsettling backdrop for the sinister events to come. the cast it must be said are all superb and are perfectly cast in their respective roles. the idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective, the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye cannot see, may even have influenced de la iglesia in his film la del of the following year, with which it bears striking similarity. i had heard mixed reviews of this particular film, but i must say i found it at all times intriguing and it even raised a few hairs on my head and gave me a few shivers, something that doesn t happen much these days, i think any negativity surrounding the film can only be attributed to its pacing, which to my eyes is perfection but to modern audiences it will be seen as deathly slow. plenty of time is given, even within its brief minutes running time, for character development and plot expansion and i must say its a new favourite of mine and certainly one of the better films of the decade.\n",

            "Review: incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all roman emperors who went insane, leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path... i know there are several versions of this, and this is based on the min one that i watched but i can t fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck br br i d heard for long about the alleged shocking content of sex nudity which honestly there isn t much of here at all and boring when there is and blood, but beware it s the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project camera work is hopelessly inept, full of strange zooms, failed framing and confusing pans to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage complete with a grainy, cheapish photo quality. lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven is it day or night are they in or outside have they changed scenes who is, or is meant to be in the shot editing is the final sin here, making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways, continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum, story progression and involvement. there is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story... but these faults distract so much it s tragic. br br a story with so many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan, burnt and fellini like turkey that s only good for a few gobble laughs and peter o toole, who makes a most memorable tiberius. oh yes, which brings us to the big name actors. i d like to line them all up one by one and just ask who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this there, i ve wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time period br br out of from ozjeppe\n",

            "Review: i only watched this because i saw a couple of good reviews for this, so i was expecting at the very least a half way cheesy movie. toybox doesn t even deliver that. there are so many problems with this flick, that i don t even know where to start, so i will list a couple of main issues once again, spoiler warning. just read them, it ll save you the trouble of watching this later . br br one, this movie starts out with, and often mentions, the mythical folklore of both celeste noir a witch, who the main character claims she is the reincarnation of , and the mid folker or something like that, an evil man with a big smile who cuts people open with hooks and sells their innards in pies . i liked that, it was a cute concept, anything to do with pies is simply enjoyable. but then you watch the movie and it s all about this idiot girl and her boyfriend and what was the deal with him was he psychic did he have powers why did he keep seeing visions that even the so called witch didn t notice , and them meeting their insane family. not really insane, they just argue a lot. that s what most of this movie is, arguing, and they barely touch on the supposed myth ever again except in a couple of confusing scenes that you can t make heads or tails of. br br in one scene, berenice the main witch related character wanders off and does some sort of ritual by candle light. it seemed rather important, but absolutely nothing happened after she did it, it just wasted more of my time. br br and who the hell was that guy with his dog you see him walking towards the house from the very start of the movie with that evil red eyed dog, and then he finally gets there and gets killed what the hell was he the mid folker was his dog possessed did someone kill the dog they never really showed that. also, any scene involving the vicar was completely pointless and only served to weakly explain the lame ending. it was like they had all these interesting character ideas and they all went nowhere the boyfriend, who obviously had some sort of powers but never explains them. the grandmother, who appeared to also have some sort of witch powers, but never used them. the vicar, who...ok, never mind, there really was no point for his existence at all. and then there was berenice and her stupid amulet. could she really do magic, or did she just use it to reflect light and blind people this was a complete waste of time, and the only reason i give it two stars at all is because a berenice is kinda cute, and b it mentioned pies. save yourself the money of renting this and dear god don t even think about buying it, unless wasting money is a new fad.\n",

            "Review: this isn t so much a review of a tale of two sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details, so i advise you not to read this review if you haven t seen the film, because doing so will absolutely ruin a few surprises for you. br br in a way a tale of two sisters is far from original, at least from a purely superficial aspect some of its iconography is taken straight from ring or dark water, while the storyline itself especially what brendt sponseller calls the rubber reality aspect of the narrative is reminiscent of films like fight club lead character interacts with someone created in their mind , mulholland drive character creates alternate reality in a psychogenic fugue , as well as other minor aspects of lost highway, jacob s ladder, and basically every film under the sun dealing with mental illness, plus amenabar s films the others, abre los ojos , memento particularly with regards to the torturous nature of memory , et al. thankfully all these similarities do not detract from the film s overall emotional impact, and i personally found a tale of two sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience. br br many people have commented on the confusing nature of the narrative, but i personally found the storyline to be fairly self explanatory, even if it is in part portrayed in a non sequential manner. the narrative only becomes confusing for some because, midway through the final third, the story switches from a purely subjective setting ie. soo mi s warped perception of reality to an objective one, with a flashback at the end explaining the origins of soo mi s nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness. the shift in emphasis is bound to throw some people off guard, but structurally i found it somewhat reminiscent of aforementioned mulholland drive even though we re not dealing with a character s perception of reality via a dream but instead their own schizophrenic tendencies something which, in turn, reminded me of another lynch movie, lost highway . to be honest, i don t really regard a tale of two sisters as a horror movie as such, but rather a tragic story of a family s breakdown as well as an honest look at a character s mental illness and i hasten to add that fans of psychoanalytical cinema are going to love this film . br br that aside, the cinematography in a tale of two sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films i ve seen this side of wong kar wai s . the performances are also fantastic without exception, and i expect to see more of the four lead actors in the future not to mention the music, but then east asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between these days. br br it s very likely that some people will look past the finer artistic points of a tale of two sisters and simply dismiss it as yet another asian horror film , oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytical approach. but then each to their own. if you can ignore some of the film s platitudinous aspects and simply take it for what it is at heart, ie. an extremely tragic, heart breaking story, then i see no reason not to recommend it.\n",

, operating a prostitution ring with an iron fist, does just that. hell hath no fury like scorpion, and a determined detective, gondo mikio narita , seeking revenge for decapitating his arm after handcuffing her, will do whatever it takes ..and that includes intimidating anyone who might know her whereabouts to catch nami. nami finds an ally in hooker yuki yayoi watanabe , who provides her a temporary shelter. yuki has a retarded brother who suffered a brain injury during a job, and must take care of him ..in a disturbing revelation, regarding incest, she also provides his sexual needs ..she, in actuality, keeps him locked up in a room while working the streets meanwhile, nami is targeted by a vile neighbor once she finds a place of her own ..she works as a sewer , and he threatens to turn her into the authorities ..nami was an escaped convict, who fled a subway from the cops if she doesn t supply him sexual favors. his wife dumps a tea kettle of boiling water all over his face and body, resulting in death, the prostitution clan come looking for nami to pay the debt of losing a very important member of their organization. that s when katsu reisen lee , the pimp s lover and confidant, realizes that the one responsible for the loss of their loyal member is a former inmate of hers, scorpion. subduing her with an injected liquid drug, placing her in a bird cage , katsu embellishes in her imprisonment. what ultimately fuels nami s rage is watching a prostitute die outside her cell, a victim of a forced late term abortion, left to bleed to death. finding a scalpel clutched in her hand ..from the operation room , nami will break free from the cage and prey upon each member of the clan responsible for the hooker s death. the series of scalpel murders provide gondo with an opportunity to catch nami, and he ll trap her in the underground sewers below the city, but can he catch or kill her especially if yuki comes to her aid br br trust me when i say there was no shackles binding director shunya ito or his film making team because female prisoner scorpion beast stable is yet another perverse, deranged, and ultra violent entry in the very entertaining series. equipped with fine production values and a visually stylistic talent for capturing all of the madness in imaginative ways, ito pulls you right ..or he did me into the twisted drama that always exists when nami matsushima is on screen. when you have a protracted opening credits sequence where your anti heroine is fleeing through the crowded city streets with a man s severed arm handcuffed to her, the viewer has to know what they re in for the incestuous sub plot is simply bizarre ..and it s shot in a soft core way with the retarded brother humping his numb, cold sister with dead eyes staring ahead , and the entire abortion sequence is rather hard to sit through. but, the abortion angle, as disturbing as it is, provides motivation for nami s revenge..despite nami s imperfect ways, and her criminal nature, you would rather see her take these cretins out than vice versa. interesting angle with detective gondo, as well. gondo is willing to break the rules, and he becomes a force of nature towards anyone who stands in his way of capturing his mortal enemy. his fate at the end, visiting another enemy of nami s, in an isolated cell, while she looks on, perfectly encapsulates what makes these films so ridiculous yet so entertaining. the scalpel murders is a montage of slumping scumbags, in various places, the blades protruding from flesh, with nami leaving the crime scenes very driven to wipe the whole clan out in memory of a fallen victim of unfortunate circumstances. while the film is essentially a comic book adventure, there s a sadness that permeates, and few characters come away without flaws. i imagine many will walk away from this scoffing at how unrealistic female prisoner scorpion beast stable is ..specifically how nami is able to escape capture time and time again, accomplishing her goals of revenge, paying back all those who have wronged her , but i looked at it as a violent action cartoon, much like the later s films, and enjoyed it for what it was. as always, this film features some beautiful asian actresses and some colorful heavies. meiko kaji, almost always reserved quiet, yet chilly staring down her enemies with violent intent, is in fine form ..in more ways than one and reisen lee, as her cross eyed, repugnant adversary, runs away with the picture as a perfectly realized contemptibly abusive foe worthy of psychological torment ..when both are in prison, nami s ways of torturing her are sweet . my favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot, but is so wonderfully wrong, features a dog discovering gondo s rotted severed arm, walking through a street eventually finding a resting place to chew on it \n",

            "Review: sometimes when a film is panned by the critics one just has to see it to see if it is really as bad as the claim, well in this case it was. i believe it was meant to be a sex comedy but it was neither sexy nor funny, i think i chuckled once when johnny vegas failed to vault a roadside fence and that was it. br br the film follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes for a living, each of them has a problem with their sex lives dave has left his wife and seeks out an old flame who once invited him for a threesome a few years before, ferris is living with his mother in law who treats him as a sex object, tolly has an obsession for involving strawberry jam in his encounters and jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship but is in fact stalking some poor woman. br br the tone of the jokes varies from tasteless to i don t believe that anybody could write that an example of the the latter being when they tell a small child his father has died in a car crash, then for the punch line when the boy asks how his mum is they tell him she is in a coma. the blame for this all lands squarely at the feet of the writers, the actors obviously made a poor choice agreeing to be in this film but i didn t think their acting was all that bad... not that it was all that good either. surprisingly for a fairly sleazy film about sex there is no nudity and the sex is never erotic. br br i certainly wouldn t recommend seeing this for any reason other than morbid curiosity although judging from other reviews this seems to be a love it or loathe it film, i suspect it would be better watched after a few beers and with your mates.\n",

            "Review: edward burtynsky is a canadian photographer who makes art out of the least artful objects imaginable. everyday items such as crates, boxes, metal containers, etc. items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit are instead converted into glorious objects d art by burtynsky s camera. he achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world for those perceptive enough to spot them, that is. even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through burtynsky s lens but didn t we already know that from wall e . he is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where man has already made incursions into nature which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures i.e. the workers in those places , with their uniform clothing and robotic movements, become part of the industrial landscape. br br manufactured landscapes, a documentary about burtynsky s work, has much of the feel of a koyaanisqatsi about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns. indeed, director jennifer baichwal and cinematographer peter mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms, as their own camera records burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in china, a dockyard in bangladesh, and the construction site at the massive three rivers gorge dam project in china. with their fluid camera work, the filmmakers match point for point the beauty of burtynsky s images. in fact, the movie opens with a stunning eight minute long tracking shot of a chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color coordinated rows. br br the movie does less well when burtynsky gets around to articulating the themes of his work, which, quite frankly, come out sounding confused, contradictory and decidedly half baked at best. but it is as a purely aesthetic experience, highlighting image and form, that manufactured landscapes resonates most. in the case of burtynsky, perhaps, a picture really is worth a thousand words.\n",

            "Review: since starting to read the book this movie is based on, i m having mixed feelings about the filmed result. i learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before i read the book, because i found that if i read the book first i was inevitably disappointed in the film. this would undoubtedly have been true here, whereas in the case of atonement, which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book i ve ever seen, it would probably not have mattered. br br i m trying to figure out what the cause is, and i suspect that i have to point my finger squarely at michael cunningham. much as i respect him for the hours which i have not read but which i saw and was awed by i cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted susan minton s book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it. br br it s not that i dislike the movie. i actually love the movie, which is why, since i started reading the novel, i m feeling disturbed about the whole thing. i feel disloyal to ms. minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work. reading it, i can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it. unlike what one reviewer of the movie said, it s not so much that some novels don t deserve to be a movie it s more like some books just can t make the transition. ms. minton s novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character, so internally, that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm. even though a lot of the book is memory of real events, it is memory, and so fragmented and ethereal as to be, i feel, not filmable. i think that ms. minton s work is a real work of literature, but cannot make the transition to film, which in no way detracts from its value. br br i cannot yet report that evening, the film, does not represent evening, the novel, in any more than the most superficial way, since i m only halfway through, but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point. i guess i m writing this because i feel that if you re going to adapt a novel, adapt it, but don t make it something else that it s not. i m not sure if michael cunningham has done anything wholly original, but from what i can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else s work. we would not have the hours if virginia woolf had not written mrs. dalloway, and we would not have evening, in its distressed form, if susan minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place. but it s too much to say that it would be better if ms. minton had left well enough alone, because evening, the film, is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own. br br thus my confusion, mixed feelings, sense of disloyalty, and ultimate conclusion that, in this case, the novel cannot be the film and vice versa, and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did, so that we have both works as they are.\n",

            "Review: this film actually works from a fairly original idea i ve never seen nymphs that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway. however, the way that it executes this idea isn t original in the slightest we follow a bunch of kids that, for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest. the fact that the forest is inhabited by these nymphs make it more interesting than merely another forest filled by rednecks nutcases zombies etc but really, the monsters are just a variation on the common horror in the woods theme. many films of this ilk don t have a single good idea and it would seem that this one has worn its brain cells out with just that one. the only real asset that the monsters bring to the table is the fact that they re beautiful women that the characters lust for, rather than being hideous grotesques that they want to run away from. this is good up until a point but it soon gets boring, and the almost complete lack of any back story surrounding the central monsters ensures that the film is never going get itself out of the horror trash category. br br it s been years since the evil dead made the woodlands a prime horror location, and in spite of films like the blair witch project it still makes for an excellent horror setting. this is one of the film s major assets, as the forest presents a good impression of the unknown the only problem is that forest of the damned doesn t ever seem to have much up its sleeve. the death sequences show a distinct lack of imagination, and the fact that all the characters are in the extreme doesn t help, as you re more likely to be looking forward to seeing them get killed rather than hoping they can get away. the cast is made up of kids mainly, but there is a role here for tom savini who unfortunately doesn t get to have fun in the special effects department. the only real highlight the film has where personnel are concerned comes from the nymphs themselves. the naked ladies tend to look great, and if it wasn t for them, this film would get very boring very quickly. there s nothing to recommend this film for really but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks, you might find some enjoyment here.\n",

            "Review: greta garbo s american film debut is an analogy of how our lives can be swept off course by fate and our actions, as in a torrent, causing us to lose a part of ourselves along the way. br br greta plays leonora, a poor peasant girl in love with ricardo cortez s character don rafael, a landowner. ricardo is in love with her too, but is too easily influenced by his domineering mother. leonora ends up homeless and travels to paris, where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation for being a loose woman. in reality, part of her attitude is bitterness over rafael s abandonment. br br she returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts rafael. surprisingly, no one knows that she s the famous la brunna, and garbo acts up her role as the diva she truly was and re prised with such cool haughtiness in her later portrayals. br br ricardo cortez reminds one a lot of valentino in looks in this part, and he was groomed to be a valentino clone by mgm, though he never thought he could be in reality and he was right. he is believable in an unsympathetic part as a weak willed mama s boy, and allows himself to age realistically but comically at the end of the movie. he fails to win leonora when she returns home, and later when he follows her, his courage is undermined. br br this movie is beautifully shot, with brilliant storm sequences and the sets depicting spain at the time are authentic looking. there are also some fine secondary performances by old timers lucien littlefield, tully marshall, and mack swain. br br although this is a story of lost love and missed chances, i don t think leonora and rafael would have been happy together, as he needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman, and i don t think would have been happy in a small village. the ending is true to life and pulls no punches. br br see this one as garbo s american film debut and a precursor of things to come\n",

            "Review: before this made for tv movie began, i had relatively low expectations. that s because it was made after the final episode of the series had aired and many of the series originals were gone. there is no president sheridan, delenn, lennier, londo, vir, g kar or lyta. if you remember, on the second to last episode of the series, all the regulars except zack, vir and captain lockley left b permanently. now for this film they did bring back garibaldi who was not in the last b movie to join zack and the captain and the doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance. but because so much is gone of the old chemistry, this film already is severely handicapped. br br the movie is about a soul hunter martin sheen who is led to babylon in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist ian mcshane . a lot of spooky mumbo jumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless. yeah, yeah, the station nearly blew up but was saved and all, but frankly i felt like it was a case of been there done that and done that a lot better in the past . br br the secondary plot, provided more for comic relief, was much more interesting, as an entrepreneur installed a holo brothel and those in command weren t sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close, they were slapped with a lawsuit. this was fluff, but it did provide a few laughs something the other dreary plot was surely lacking. br br by the way, sheen at first did a good job playing the should hunter with his wild eyes and bizarre delivery. however, repeatedly throughout the episode he fell out of character. this should have been spotted and corrected. br br so the final verdict is this is only for total die hard b nuts like myself . others seeing it might assume the series sucked which is a great injustice. this is a great example of a show not knowing when to quit.\n",

            "Review: this is an epic film about the unification of the ancient kingdoms of china in the third century bc. what makes it interesting is the tragic downfall of the king and all the palace intrigue going on around him. it reminded me a bit of king lear and some of the other shakespeare plays. br br the king starts out with noble ambitions, to unify the kingdoms under one ruler and to stop all the quarrelling so that the people can prosper and lead better lives. he and his childhood sweetheart, played beautifully by li gong, concoct a scheme whereby she pretends to go into exile in a rival kingdom in order to recruit an assassin to kill the king, thus giving him a pretext to go to war. but while she s away, the king becomes sadistic in his lust for power and goes on a killing spree. br br there are numerous side plots that keep the action going. there is the marquis, who pretends to be stupid and foppish but who s really very clever and wants to become king himself. he fathers two children with the king s mother and manages to keep it secret for years. then there is the prime minister, a political rival to the king, who turns out to really be his father. br br the assassin is a complex character himself. an adept swordsman and killer, he is undergoing a reformation when the king s lover comes to recruit him. he wants nothing more with killing, but is eventually won over by li gong who wouldn t be when he sees how cruel and vicious the king has become. br br some spectacular cinematography, especially the battle scenes that are carried out on a grand scale like they used to say, a cast of thousands, literally. the acting is ok, nothing special. it s the story that s interesting, though at over two and a half hours, it pushes the limit. br br definitely worth viewing.\n",

            "Review: this movie is a rather odd mix of musical, romance, drama and crime with a sniff of film noir to it. it s basically one messy heap of different genres, of which none really works out like it was supposed to. br br this movie is an attempt by mickey rooney to be taken more serious as an actor. he s a former child star who always used to star in in happy comical and musical productions at the start of his career. in this movie he picks a different approach although the musical aspects are still present in the movie . but his role is actually quite laughable within the movie. i mean mickey rooney as a tough player he s an extremely small boyish looking man. he actually was in his s already at the time of this movie but he seriously looks more like a year old. hearing him say babe to women and hearing talking tough to gangsters who are about times bigger than he is just doesn t look and feel right. he simply isn t convincing in his role. br br because the movie mixes so many different genres, the story also really feels as a messy one. somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plot line and one about living your dream but none of it works out really due to the messy approach and handling of it all. it just isn t an interesting or compelling movie to watch. kardos is also a director who has done only movies in his lifetime, despite the fact that his career span from till . he must have been a struggling director who had a hard time getting work into the industry and instead once in a while was given a lesser script to work with. his movies are all unknown ones and normally also not of too high quality. br br let s also not forget that this is a s movie but yet it more feels like a s one or perhaps even as one from the s. this is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black white. generally speaking black white movies from the s often have a cheap looking feeling over it and this movie forms no exception. br br it s a rather strange sight seeing mickey rooney and louis armstrong and his band as themselves performing together in a sequence. it wasn t the only movie armstrong appeared in though and he would often pop up in these type of movies, often simply as himself. i guess jazz lovers can still somewhat enjoy watching this movie due to its music, since there is quite an amount of it present in this movie. the movie actually received an oscar nomination for best original song. br br an awkward little movie and outing from mickey rooney. br br \n",

            "Review: a major disappointment. this was one of the best uk crime drama detective shows from the s which developed the fascinating title character played by scotland s robbie coltrane. however this one off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus. coltrane isn t really given much to do, much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer, and in what he has to act in, he seems uninvolved, almost bored. the ex soldier s story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on coltrane s family life seems lightweight. perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one two hour show they would have written this with much more depth. as is, skip this and watch the old cracker from the s which is far far superior.\n",

            "Review: godard once said a way to criticize a movie is to just make one, and probably the strongest kind that could be made about ralph bakshi s take on tolkien s magnum opus the lord of the rings, has actually been made by peter jackson. the recent trilogy, to me, aren t even total masterpieces, but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the post modern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good, sweeping entertainments. br br but as one who has not read the books, i end up now looking upon the two versions, live action albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way and animated albeit partly done with actual live action as the framework in relation to just the basic story, not even complete faithfulness to the books. and with bakshi s version, it s almost not fair in a way, as what we do see is really not the complete vision, not what jackson really had probably final cut . robbed of return of the king s big climactic rush of the story, and with the other two parts becoming rushed, i ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations, though as such those same limitations make it disappointing. br br what s interesting too, after seeing the jackson films first which i also slightly regret being that i might ve reacted to this differently when i was younger and prior to five years ago is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with. everything that is really needed to tell the fellowship of the ring story is actually pretty much intact, and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in tolkien s book is given some clarity in this section. the actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes, are more or less adequate for the parts, with a few parts standing out john hurt as aragorn and william squire as gandalf . br br the lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little face value for those who ve not even seen the other films or read the books and can t put them into context. but there is some level of interest always with the characters, and here there s a more old fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more. this is not a garden variety disney adaptation warts and all, this is a bakshi film, with his underground animation roots colliding with the mythical world of middle earth. br br and what bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen, in all its abbreviated form, its hit or miss appeal. along with being not totally complete as a film, or as stories, the form of the film is an experiment, to see if something can be entirely rotoscoped. the results end up bringing what seems now to be retro, but at the time of course was something that was a rough, crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers. might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation in some parts, yeah it does become a little noticeable, as was also the case in bakshi s american pop, that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky, like some kind of comic book form done in a different way. still, there s much i admired in what was done. br br the orcs, for example, i found to be really amazing in they re surreal surroundings. they re maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live action, especially during parts where there isn t battle footage that s really the real hit or miss section, as there isn t continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping , and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback. it s creepy in a good way. and the backgrounds, while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy, are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together. it s almost something for art film buffs as much as for the ring nuts. br br so, how would i recommend this animated take on the lord of the rings i don t know, to tell the truth. it s certainly a good notch above the other tolkien animated film i ve seen, the hobbit and i ve yet to see the animated rotk , and there is some real artistry going on. there s also some stilted dialog, an all too rushed two towers segment with the most intriguing character gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all. and seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness of the more recent films. br br if you re a fan of the books contemplating checking this out, i would say it s worth a chance, even if it s one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not. as for it fitting into bakshi s other films i ve seen it s an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement, where as with lynch s dune it s bound to draw a dark, mordor like line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who don t. i don t.\n",

of the james hilton novel. what i like about the version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented. the film has a prestigious cast and a gifted director and cinematographer. this is a burt bacharach shangri la and it s a wonderful place. songs like the world is a circle, share the joy and living together, growing together evoke a happiness that hilton wrote about in his novel. why shouldn t shangri la be a slightly goofy place the two love songs, i might frighten her away and the deleted i come to you are the sensitive spots in the picture. there s a peacefulness and soft spoken quality in both these songs that is very much keeping with the philosophy of the story. moreover, the things i will not miss is a good duet with a strong melody. it s a nice exchange of different types of perspective and who can fault with olivia hussey and sally kellerman stomping, singing and dancing on tables they re a wonderful team and the number is well staged. br br i always found it interesting in this story how the high lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in shangri la. the character of the high lama is a gentle soul but somewhat radical in his view of mankind as a whole. he has no hope for the world outside of shangri la. if this film were to be remade today, it would be interesting to see more emphasis put on the leading character, richard onway s conflict with what he left behind in the outside world as opposed to what he s found in shangri la. br br of course, for the film to be believable, the character of richard conway must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end, like he was in the book. neither film versions of lost horizon were faithful to the novel in that regard. did conway find shangri la or was it imagined did they all die in the plane crash every man has his own idea of what his shangri la would be. the conflict with conway wanting to believe in shangri la and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful. i like the melancholy on the faces of kellerman, kennedy and van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. interesting how conway doesn t want to leave paradise, but is being pressured out by his brother. both versions of lost horizon work in different ways, but both are successful in probing james hiltons ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. so in a sense it s anti capitalism in it s theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation. human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule. br br lost horizon has a much stronger story than most musicals. it attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding. one has to remember that lost horizon in was post cabaret. it was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. lost horizon was an easy target for jaded critics. the expectations for it were high, almost unreasonable. there were two targets to be hit, the producer, ross hunter and burt bacharach and the critics were out to get both of them. ross hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and lost horizon was his follow up film to his blockbuster airport that film was universals biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films. for years airport was the most watched film ever to be shown on television. it was nominated for academy awards including best picture. at the time, burt bacharach and hal david were the most successful songwriters in the country. the unabashed sentimentality of lost horizon hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like easy rider, midnight cowboy and the godfather. sex and violence was a new frontier in the late s and early s audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen. lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made. today lost horizon can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels. it s the ultimate escapist film with a strong story, wonderful music, an expensive budget and some quirky humor. it s unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until minutes into the film. it changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not lost horizon is a heavenly film that deserves rediscovering. a lost and legendary treasure deserving far better than it s reputation.\n",

            "Review: i was looking forward to this movie. trustworthy actors, interesting plot. great atmosphere then if you are going to attempt something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life. first. know it. ok i did not expect the directors or writers to actually know the meaning but i thought they may have offered crumbs to peck at and treats to add fuel to the fire which they almost did. things i didn t get. a woman wandering around in dark places and lonely car parks alone oblivious to the consequences. great riddles that fell by the wayside. the promise of the knowledge therein contained by the original so called criminal. i had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense. i understood and can wax lyrical about the fool and found adrian pauls role crucial and penetrating and then basically the story line and the script where good up to a point and that point was the last minutes or so. what run out of ideas such a pity that this movie had to let us down so badly. it may not comprehend the meaning and i really did not expect the writers to understand it but i was hoping for an intellectual, if not spiritual ride and got a bump in the road\n",

            "Review: after reading the book, which had a lot of meaning for me, the movie didn t give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed. this makes me wonder if kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else.either that or he is simply bad. most importantly where is the lightness from the very first scene, music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling, and this continues right through the movie. i think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie, this would make the story feel light however they have completely failed here. instead the music manages to give everything that movie feel , in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them, so that everything actually feels heavy. br br another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic. in the movie we see franz passing tomas on the street, who is on his way to see sabina. the introduction of this chance meeting passing, which im sure didn t happen in the book, gives tomas story more significance than it does make it light. br br there are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed, imo for the worst, however this might have been done because the book simply doesn t convert well into a movie, such is kundera s style. this makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book and movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film. a film which is as long as it is uncompelling. for those who haven t read the book yet i recommend just reading that. for those who have, i have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stay clear warnings.\n",

            "Review: surprisingly good made for t.v. thriller. i wasn t expecting too much from this one but i m glad to say that this is one of the best of it s kind. it s fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. br br the story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can t help but find the movie very interesting. br br the background story of thiessen s character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend s step father. br br the stranger concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society. a serial rapist does not respect society or even his own family and this movie displays the sickness and crime in a perfect way. br br my beef with the movie was the non sense situation when thiessen s character returns home with her deranged husband after he s released on bail. by that moment she knew what he did to his young relative played by the cute allyson hannigan . but that s just the typical hollywood scene that provokes more trouble. br br the climax scene shows thiessen following her husband when he s about to commit another rape, then she calls the cops who come in time just to capture him. the ending tells us that the husband was sentenced for years in prison in real life. br br the acting is also pretty good, and tiffany is great and gorgeous as always. the direction is also very good.\n",

            "Review: this is not direct as a matter of fact it is its opposite. second installment of filmmaker gatlif s gypsy trilogy, this french work produced by ray gavras, is a film masterpiece, not pure documentary, no fiction by any means. instead, gatlif has chosen different locations of the route from india to spain, wherever the rom people have a strong presence, and with the help of art directors he has staged several musical numbers that tell us how the gypsies live, sing, dance, struggle and have survived. the movie may have strong opposition from those who question the hypothesis that the rom tribe is of indian origin, mostly challenged by those who see a direct link with the hebrews so, in a way, it comes as no surprise that they were also persecuted by the nazis. but above any anthropological argument, this is a work of great beauty, strong colors and wonderful singing and dancing.\n",

            "Review: in the small american town of meadowvale dr. anthony blake david gale, the imdb listing for this character is wrong it s definitely dr. blake not dr. blakely is the director and founder of the famed psychological research institute and also host s a local t.v. programme called independent thinkers . he uses this t.v. show to hypnotise the viewers and make them commit acts of violence. dr. blake has the help of a large brain with an evil face that uses it s spinal cord as a tail thingy. usually the brain is just sitting in a tank, eats mice and the odd bad actor, each time it eats someone it gets much bigger. meanwhile at the local high school gifted but troublesome teenager jim majelewski tom bresnahan has been caught putting sodium down the toilets. jim is sent to dr. blake at the pri for help with his attitude and behavioural problems. while there dr. blake hooks jim up to, well something i m not actually sure what. this whatever it is, is attached to the brain. at first jim is able to resist the brain s mind control. the brain feels that jim is a threat to itself and it s plans. once out of the pri jim starts having bizarre hallucinations and crashes his car. jim makes it to his waitress girlfriend janet cynthia preston as cyndy preston but is handed back to dr. blake s assistant verna george buza soon after by officer marks harry booker . the brain wants to kill jim because he is the only one capable of withstanding it s mind control techniques, and with independent thinkers going national the brain doesn t want anything or anyone to stop it s evil plan for world domination jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain, before it takes over the world br br directed by ed hunt who calls himself edward hunt here, the brain wasn t as bad as i thought it was going to be. don t get me wrong as it certainly isn t great either. the script by barry pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by t.v. storyline. it moves along at a fair pace and isn t too boring. no explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all, it s just there and that s it we have to accept it. the story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element, there s the t.v. mind control, the brain itself, jim being hunted by the police his misbehaviour and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding dr. blake that isn t explained at all. production wise this film looks cheap, and probably was cheap. the acting isn t great but i ve seen worse, and what is david gale doing in this in fact this role is similar to gale s role in re animator even down to his character s deaths in both films. the brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big. each stage is just made of rubber. it doesn t look particularly good and isn t scary or creepy, just cheap. there s no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and you ll miss it decapitation. the nudity is provided by dr. blake s assistant vivian christine kossak as christine kossack before she gets eaten. the brain had a certain entertainment value for me but i would think most people would dislike it. maybe worth a watch if you can see it on t.v. for free.\n",

            "Review: the narrative affirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a struggle of brother against brother. the main character, lin macadam, played by james stewart, represents justice and righteousness. his brother, who operates under the persona of dutch henry brown, played by stephen mcnally, stands for the classic stage coach robbing western outlaw, chased by his brother for having killed their father. the world the story takes place is the classic dystopian west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter town, and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic western lawman wyat earp. br br present as well are such flat characters typical of the western, such as the murderous indian warrior, the besieged cavalryman, and the bonnet clad damsel in distress. br br another important archetype in this film, that which gives the film it s name, is a custom made winchester rifle. the weapon can be viewed as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honorably. once it is stolen from its rightful owner, it brings tragedy to everyone that comes in contact with it. in this sense it resembles other such icons like the holy grail in raiders of the lost ark, and the blood stained letter in saving private ryan. this gives the film an element of surrealism which is usually absent from westerns, a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols. br br being essentially a revenge film, it shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as jack arnold s no name on the bullet, and clint eastwood s unforgiven. br br there is also a tacit theme of rape in winchester . waco johnny dean, one of the film s villains played very effectively by dan duryea, abducts a woman after killing her husband. the volatile cowboy toys with the tenderfoot husband, and dispatches him like a caricature of a cat toying with an insect before biting its head off. waco johnny dean eventually gets what is coming to him after coming in contact with the ominous winchester rifle. br br the main story of winchester is reminiscent of the mythological tale of jason and his quest for the golden fleece, as told in apollonius argonautica. both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object that possesses some sort of intangible quality. like jason, stewart s character hops from one adventure to the next in search of a one of a kind prize. another theme in winchester that is similar to a mythic tale is the struggle between brothers. several stories of antiquity deal with this issue, such as the hebrew bible s tale of cain and abel, and the vulgate tale of romulus and remus. br br as for the theme of abduction and rape present in anthony mann s film, it is present in many mythological works, such as the rape of europa as told by ovid in his metamorphoses. br br winchester is a fine example of the western genre, and acts as the objective correlative for many classic american western and ancient mythological themes.\n",

            "Review: this is far worse than those awful laurel and hardy cartoons of the s. they were terrible, but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then stan and ollie resurgence. new audiences had rediscovered the pair s comedic genius and the cartoons were mind numbing garbage geared to cash in on children s interest. it was to be expected. but, how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of... i can t even think of a word. i m sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another laurel and hardy revival, but you can t inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing. the impressionists i hesitate to call them actors do a vegas act and that s where it belongs. the plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days, trying to stretch out two reel ideas for a feature. if this film was someone s first exposure to the real laurel and hardy, i m sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo s reputation as senility gone amok. the only movie i hate worse than this is i spit on your grave. and, you know, these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to stan and ollie.\n",

            "Review: commissaire bourvil is a single with a little gun who loves cats and his boss at the paris police department is a philosopher who knows that even the police becomes sooner or later guilty. that is what the film is all about. and a jewel robbery at the place vendome. br br corey delon brings the plan from prison, him and helps him against two tough guys, who are after him, because he took mafioso ricos andre eycan money, while rico already took coreys girl friend and left him very much alone for five years in jail. corey and vogel find a third man, jansen montand , a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by shooting special hand made ammunition into a hole. a perfect plan and cooperation, but they have to sell the booty and there is mattei in the role of a buyer in disguise. the circle closes. running to help each other they are shot by the cat loving mattei and his little pistol. br br it took melville years he says to make a robbery film after he failed to get a contract for riffifi. melville wrote the screenplay and filmed in the south of france and in paris of yesteryear. the great henri decae is as usual the lighting cameraman. it is the one before last picture of melvilles who died after another film with delon in . br br melville actually wanted belmondo instead of he didn t like that italian at all, but is an excellent fugitive and gives next to bourvil the most convincing performance. but mind you melville notes, that is an instinctive actor, a strange character, very wearying and absolutely impossible on a french set. melville didn t like him at all and didn t want to work with him ever again. br br melville is wrong. give the most lively character in the nowhere of not so many interesting characters. you can see what he is feeling being chased by mattei and his little dangerous gun and all the dogs of france in winter . a wild actor. br br also bourvil, who passed away close to the time of the filming. he also was not first choice, but definitely a great substitute. he carries the instinct of a lonely hunter through the whole film and gets in the end his chance to become guilty once more. br br jansen has entered at night the jewelry shop with a rifle and a tripod but risks eventually freehandedly a successful shot. when he meets delon the first time we already know that the elegant jansen has a severe drinking problem. after the robbery montand renounces to take his part of the booty and mentions to delon, who looks up to him, that he only got into the red circle, because he wanted to take revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe. delon doesn t catch what he means. the audience recalls having seen montand in a great scene in his haunted house fighting helplessly nightmare creatures that come out of the wardrobe and attack him. at that time a very rare scene, one recalls a long time after. i bet it was ever so difficult to arrange and direct that stuff at a time no one imagined the coming days of digital movie making. great artwork when art was made by hand. br br we sure will remember a crew like the actors, still it seems even after years this one stays the less popular of the six thrillers of melville. what is wrong with it i am afraid one doesn t take much interest in those three actors showing three criminals and their police hunter. we learn too little about corey and his fatal years away from his beautiful girl anna douking . montand is still a great sniper, but what made him become a drinking man with funny creatures in his wardrobe. delon acts as if he is in an earlier adventure of the samourai, is the man in the trunk of delons american car and superbly moving and mattei is swell to look at, a great actor at the edge of his life. but how could he ever possibly doubt that all are guilty br br in an interview melville states, that there is no woman in the film. not in the very red circle, but i remember well that jolly good looking female anna douking with no future career . we are in the s. there in fact rises a woman from the bed of an old mafioso wearing nothing and walks slowly to the door to listen to the voice of her old lover delon. bardot did something like that years earlier. this time melville was directing. well done. br br the red cercle has certainly added a few but not many glittering gems to film history. the robbery at place vendome and montands wonder bullet the inhabitants of the wardrobe and escaping bouvil in white underwear and carrying his trousers carefully across a stream. that is too little for a great gangster and robbery movie. but the minutes never bore you and it is a game on a high level. and there are probably some secrets you learn when you see the film over and over again. none of the secrets is that we are all guilty and the late francois perier is also featured. br br michael zabel\n",

            "Review: this was a very good show. i enjoyed the construction of real time and flashback, seeing the old diggers meeting again and recalling the terrors of their captivity in changi pow camp. the main problem with the way the show was written is that the scenes of life in changi are more like a holiday camp than what the place must have been like. i am old enough to remember film footage of the men being liberated from changi and other japanese pow camps. no actor could lose enough weight to have a resemblance of the state of those men. they made the jews of belsen look like sumo wrestlers. i have met several veterans from changi over the years. many would never ride in a japanese car, let alone own one. the physical and mental torture those men endured was too horrific for them to even talk about. what percentage survived john doyle might be ok writing comedy for roy and hg i hate that too but this is a serious sugar coating of history that should never have been tolerated. i m happy for satirists to write the life of brian and make fun of the crucifixion because it is obviously comedy, even if some consider it to be in bad taste. changi is written as a portrayal of a real event and, as such, might be regarded by younger people as a true record. great performances by a fine cast cannot redeem this lightweight screenplay.\n",

tro s or orders of protection are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so although they are generally only this easy against men. they are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here. indeed, girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever, but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats, and sometimes without even hearing his side. even when there is a hearing, it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats to prove a negative , when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused, rather than the accuser. this is one of the only areas of american law where that is true and it s a signal outrage of feminist overreaching, and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller. of course that s not likely to be the subject of any lifetime movie in this lifetime. br br the absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the something is psychotic, and isn t taking her medicine. even so it makes no sense. she isn t after the successful lawyer ex husband, though she does con his help to the ex wife s fury in her quest. she s after the house technically, to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease . this second younger woman is after all that s left after the divorce, after affairs with other somethings stole her husband the ex husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling doesn t matter, he still strayed br br the protagonist is good enough looking for her age. but her outlook, attitude and focus is so small minded, frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it s impossible to care about her. well, a core group of lifetime fans care, i guess, judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it. i kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal. i couldn t resist seeing just how far they d take it. br br spoiler if such a thing is possible with this flick . br br well, here s a clue. the movie ends with the something getting bailed out of jail by promising to listen to her something male co worker and sometimes lover, and do whatever he says and let him take care of her he means get her to keep taking her medicine and then tricking him and returning to the house. there she climbs the stairs with a knife, demonicly stalking her nemesis something, who is taking a bath by candlelight, secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life. there s a struggle and the something mom wins by sticking the something with a hypodermic needle full of anti psychotic medicine she had found. she then begins stroking her, mom like, and the two women have a bonding, female solidarity moment how sweet.\n",

            "Review: an elite american military team which of course happens to include two good looking women and a guy who can t quite grasp teamwork, lots of bats, some terrorists, and a spetznaz team that acts like the gang that can t shoot straight all thrown together in a jumbled plot with mediocre acting. this one has nothing much going for it. the characters are not compelling. even the setting, which has great possibilities, looks like something out of the middle of rural pennsylvania, not an exotic boreal forest in eastern europe. br br the bats are certainly ferocious looking. they can even pick up a man and fly with him for a few feet harpies or chop off an arm. you see delta force surrounded by hundreds of bats with a guys shooting assault rifles and pistols at them and bat flopping to the ground. it would be like trying to shoot skeet with a rifle from a distance of feet. utterly clueless. the dialogue is rancidly unrealistic, with boy girl jokes and flirts in the middle of tense parts of the mission. one of the team is blown up by a mine and the first one on the scene just stares sadly at his body, stunned, not even bothering to take cover or secure the area. in fact after the rest of the group shows up he talks about how the area is laid out like a minefield thanks for the heads up bub. br br if you want a contrast in how a horror movie involving a small military group can be done well on a low budget check out outpost. harvest is not the movie you want to see. in fact i think i m going to give it a two instead of a three if i can make it through the second half. seems unlikely at this point.\n",

            "Review: i particularly enjoyed delly s review of this film and agree that howard is not the only damaged character. howard is rather ruthlessly set up by the script, but there is no evidence that his previous employer is actually dead or, if she is, that he murdered her. howard doesn t know and neither do we. in terror and confusion at seeing the woman lying there, he bolts. however, he never actually harms helen gordon, no matter how enraged he is. indeed, he reacts with horror at helen s fainting spell and the fact that he is holding a pair of scissors...then he resumes his tidying up and greets the recovered helen with the almost pathetic i m very tired now. i think i ll go home . frankly, i don t think he s a psychopath. a sick puppy, certainly, but not a psychopath. br br the problem with howard is that he has no real male identity. he wanted to serve his country, but his mental condition denies him a place in the army. he is singularly rootless and isolated no wife, no girl, no home again, at least as far as we know . and, he does a woman s job floor s are my speciality . helen s niece ruthlessly strips away this pride in his thoroughness by exclaiming caustically that she would want a man with a real job. also, although he finds himself strongly attracted to helen, he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass. he is remarkably powerless can t fight, can t work, can t make love. br br helen is justifiably terrified, however. she tries to connect to him but, finding that he doesn t respond normally i.e. way outside the comfort zone provided by her rose tinted memories of husband ned , unwittingly presses all howard s buttons by lying to him in her attempt to escape. br br both characters, trapped in the house, trapped by fear, neuroses, rage and memory, deserve sympathy. i know the sudden ending has disappointed some reviewers, but i felt it fitted well, as it offered a kind of release to the characters. helen is freed, i think, from the past. when howard tries on her husband s army coat, helen s disgusted reaction is highlighted. she no doubt feels that the sacredness of ned s possessions has been violated but, hopefully, her need to keep everything untouched has been lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger. perhaps she can move on. br br howard is also freed from his endless cycle of anger, hurt and violence. whether he moves on to treatment or to jail is debatable, but i hope it s the former. br br great performances from ryan and lupino. i prefer on dangerous ground , but this is pretty good too.\n",

            "Review: star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br one time heroin addict frankie machine frank sinatra gets out of prison to his bumbling jailbird partner sparrow arnold stang , needy cripple of a wife zosch eleanor parker and bit on the side molly kim novak. he s trying to make it big as a drummer in a band, but until his big break comes along he s stuck doing the only other thing he was any good at other than being a junkie dealing cards in high stakes games. and try as he might, even prison hasn t cured him of his addiction to the devil s drug causing him to lie to and deceive all those around him and driving him to desperate measures to feed his habit. his yearning to come off it is his only motivation towards a happy ending. br br when people think of frank sinatra they generally think of classic high pitched songs like under my skin, new york new york and it had to be you. but lest anyone forget he was actually a renowned actor too and, if his performance in the acclaimed from here to eternity wasn t enough, he will also be remembered for this cutting edge drama, dealing with what was at the time the ultra taboo subject of drug abuse. br br the film is often listed as one of the first to feature graphic heroin use probably the reason behind the certificate in a time when it was a subject that was still very much pushed underground. in his portrayal of the main protagonist, sinatra is fine, perfectly conveying the despair, desperation and sincerity of a man losing every second chance that is being given to him. his cold turkey scene is much more intense than ewan mcgregor s in trainspotting. the first co star to make an impression is parker as machine s demanding, needy cripple of a wife, using her husband s guilt and sense of duty to all the effect she can. novak as his secret lover still manages some strong moments but is less of a star than parker. stang does his usual comic relief thing, as the bumbling sidekick who trails the leading man around with his waspy new york accent. br br director otto preminger does allow the pace to drag a bit sometimes but this is still a powerfully absorbing film all the way, with plenty of unexpected twists and turns and which should be admired for being one of the first films to bring such a grim subject so powerfully to life. \n",

            "Review: as a gamer, i can t say i like this film. fact is, i down right hate it. i tried to watch it as open minded as possible, but when it gets down to it, it feels rather insulting to my social group. br br to me, there are several reasons why. br br . the characters seem unnatural. i ve met lots of players, of all different walks of life. i don t know any who act like any of the characters in the film. it s like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into people. most gamers are rather social people, some with rather active lives. br br . the style doesn t work. the mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film. an actual documentary on gamers would actually work better. while it is good looking i.e. cleanly put together , it isn t very good. br br . the dialogue feels forced, unnatural. it also seems to lack any real world context. gamers swear, i ll admit that, but we don t have tourette s syndrome. br br . the humor is lacking. while self deprecating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups i ve encountered, this is less self deprecation, and more like toilet humor. likewise, a large part of gamer humor is full of in jokes and anecdotes, not toilet humor. most gamers would balk at and shun anybody who made such jokes. br br . the biggest problem to me is basically this accuracy. i don t mean rules, but instead dynamics. invariably, this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films the gamers and the gamers dorkness rising, both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game. the difference is, gamers the movie presents a situation where you want to beat the players senseless vs. the gamers, where you can say something like huh, i know a guy like that... yep, that s definitely like gary. \n",

            "Review: i think that my favorite part of this movie, the one that exemplifies the sheer pointless, stupidity and inanity of the proceedings, comes at the climax of the film. doctor ted nelson and his unmarried friend the sheriff have finally cornered the melting man on a landing on some stairs in an electrical generating plant. keep in mind that nelson has been looking for the mm for nearly the entire film, and that the mm has killed and eaten several people at this point including his boss , and nelson is very aware that mm is violently insane and hungry for human flesh and blood. br br so the sheriff has his gun pointed at mm, who is, and i give the movie and rick baker props for this, the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form that we have ever seen. and he yells a very important question to doctor ted nelson what do we do now br br the camera cuts over to doctor ted nelson, and it s obvious that ted has no idea what to do next. apparently ted was so intent on the problem of finding the melting man, he never thought to bring along some restraining devices, a lasso, or straitjacket, or a net, or some tranquilizer darts, or maybe a new age tape by vangelis to soothe the savage beast. br br so the sheriff panics and shoots, the melting man goes berserk, and hilarity ensues. br br maybe this explains why nasa has been screwing around with the space shuttle program in sub lunar space for the last years instead of going back to the moon or out to mars like everyone knows they ought to be doing. i dunno. br br anyway, that s the kind of lousy, lazy writing and direction that undercuts every aspect of this movie. it s hard to say how good the actors actually are, because the movie has complete contempt for their characters. br br two other incredibly painful sequences also ramp up the stupidity of the proceedings there is a scene featuring the lumpiest old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a grove, only to be torn apart by the melting man. this scene is a nadir in s cinema. i can guarantee you ve never watched a more pointless and irritating setup with odder looking people in your entire life. and the melting man s assault on the lady who lives in the house where they keep a horse who pees on the walls defies every attempt to process it. btw, i think famous film director jonathon demme has a walk on in this scene as the redneck husband who goes in first to check on the house and never comes out again . the only thing that keeps the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that, as i said, their horse has apparently been peeing on it. and we are forced to watch her hysterics for at least two minutes longer than any sane film director would hold the shot. br br burr debenning ought to beat the crap out of imm s director and photographer. i remember him from an old columbo episode where he looked much better than he does here no one s idea of a leading man, but solid and unobtrusive. but no one could possibly be as unappealing in real life as his director makes him look here. br br everyone else comes off a little better except for the old couple and shut up, i know they were being played for laughs, but i ain t laughing but not much. br br this definitely falls into the so bad you can t look away category of cinema disasters. still, i d watch it again before i d watch a lot of other s and s abortions track of the moonbeast and it lives by night come to mind , and mst s coverage of it is great fun, so if you get a chance, watch the mst version.\n",

            "Review: i m going to recommend putting this one in the skip it pile as well. i was mildly excited by the concept when my rented it, and a bit more excited when i saw that milos forman directed it. ah, well..... br br the costumes were nice, sure, but they were typical. there was nothing about them that said they were from anywhere but the period costume department of any major hollywood studio. there was no distinction between spanish, british and french everyone dressed like they were at court in versailles. the sets somehow didn t evoke the qualities of the settings the prison didn t feel like a prison, the mansions didn t feel like mansions, and the outside scenes looked like they were filmed on a back lot, for all that they were probably practical locations. br br the score was dramatically less than it could have been. i have been a fan of film scores since my youth, noticing, appreciating and collecting them, by which i mean more than john williams. my is a professional film composer, an award winner who has had her works performed at lincoln center, and a rising star in the industry. at the start of the film, we had high hopes for it, and it did indeed start off nicely. it rapidly deteriorated, and at several points including the scene of the release of the prisoners it actually reached a level of annoyance. i actually reached for the remote to turn down the volume. the score was never anything more than the most obvious choice for scoring a specific tone of scene, and didn t integrate itself into the soul of the film think of the music in babel and you ll have an idea of what i mean . it never attained the grandeur it wanted to, but then neither did the film. br br javier bardem, as talented as he is, was awful. for the first part of the film, his mannerisms are so distracting that it takes over his performance. during the second half, everything that was his character in the first half is gone, replaced by an entirely different set of annoying mannerisms, and he looked like the love child of keith richards and stuart townshend s lestat. i never got the idea that he cared about the role which is to say, that the character cared about his life and actions , or that the character was ever drawn by the writers as anything more than an opportunist who, for whatever reason, changes his mind and decides to stick by his principles at the end. br br natalie portman was very good, although her performance lacked the shades of increasing insanity between her release from the prison and taking lorenzo s hand at the end that i would have needed to call it truly an effective performance. the character of alicia was never defined enough to truly discern, and if it weren t for the superb makeup on her eyes and cheeks, someone seeing the beginning of the film and the end wouldn t know they weren t the same character. the prosthetic teeth were horrible, artificial and distracting, but that s no knock on ms. portman. br br stellan was fine as goya. not oscar worthy, but serviceable and generally believable. i don t know much about the life of goya, or his deafness, but it seemed to be tacked on to the movie as a requirement of biographical information, rather than anything that was utilized in the film. i am sure it affected goya s life much more than just requiring the need of an interpreter, but you d never know it from watching this. for the record, words and sounds can only be correctly interpreted roughly of the time through lip reading. br br don t get me started on randy quaid. at least he was a minor character. br br the script reads like one of the choose your own adventure books i used to read as a kid at several moments through the film, several outcomes are possible, and none of the actions preceding them lead with any certainty to the way the film actually plays out. ironically, the film is also predictable, especially its meager attempts at leavening the mood through small bits of humor. the joke about the hands maybe it s because i paint not well as a hobby and know what a pita hands are to draw paint, but i saw the joke coming a mile away, as well as the reprise in the second half. was the baby ever there for any other reason other than to be taken by ines there might as well have been a line of bread crumbs. br br disappointing. br br note this review is a copy of a reply i made to a thread in the forum \n",

            "Review: first of all, this movie isn t a complete disaster. if you had never heard of the real story of gram parsons then it might seem a reasonably entertaining diversion. johnny knoxville can t really be criticised for his performance as phil kaufman he s pretty good at looking laid back and down to earth and you can sort of root for his long suffering everyman. michael shannon is due credit for pretty much the same reasons, except he s a hippy stoner. there are some good individual comedic scenes the hippy hearse crashing into the airport hanger door stands out. but that s where the good things end, and we begin to see the aspects that make this movie so truly disappointing. the character of robert forster as gram s actual father is an invention so disgraceful as to cast a taint over the entire film. we all know his real father committed suicide when he was young something that could surely be compared to gram s life on the edge by a better film maker. having forster as his supposed real father, and not his step father would be bad enough, if not for the well known difficulties gram had with the man who actually flew to collect his body. it has been suggested that his step father had admitted to providing gram s mother with alcohol as she lay dying and that this enraged gram when he later found out about it. also the controversy over where gram s body was buried would surely be reason enough not to invent a benevolent made up father who actually catches up to the duo and their hearse, but then allows them to go ahead with the burning. whatever the truth about the man who gram got the name parsons from, he certainly bore no resemblance to forster s character here, and it is hard to see why this role was written. then there s the addition of christina applegate as a greedy chick yet very pretty of course who wants gram s body back so that she can begin to cash in on his estate. her character, and her acting are non existent and one wonders why the director didn t just go the whole hog and include a lesbo scene between her and the chick who plays kaufman s girlfriend it wouldn t have lowered the tone a whole lot more . when you think of the ingredients that could have been used in a good movie about parsons, the shortcomings of this film are easily apparent. country music being changed by a young, polite, southern gentleman who was also long haired, drug loving, popular with the ladies and ultimately self destructive. real events like the hanger door crash and the painted hearse and friends like keith richards. instead of these things we have to concentrate wholly on kaufman s input into gram s life. kaufman is obviously still lapping up the cult status he received for what he did he certainly is a little cult . from interviews it is obvious that he s delighted with the attention. remember this is the man who made a remark about the genitalia of the naked corpse of gram parsons as he was preparing to set it alight. what he did was not an act of great loyalty, but a doped up alcoholic escapade. looking at knoxville and the director in interviews, a few things become clear also. it s obvious that they have no real grasp of the story of gram s life, nor do they wish to have. they want a hit movie about an event that is infamous and crazy. it was an amazing life with a strange end. that the end is the only thing covered by this movie shows how limited an understanding of gram parsons the makers had.\n",

            "Review:  warning minor spoilers br br i ran into this one partway through and watched from there, not knowing what it was or what the plot was. it certainly held my attention i didn t know until the ending that it was based on a true story the guy she used to do the dirty deed came out looking like a seriously nice guy who just got his head twisted around by a devious girl i have to question how true to life that portrayal is. anyone who would murder a husband and wife as they slept just can t be entirely nice. still, i did have some sympathy for him, as he had been set up and taken advantage of that much was made clear. br br my main complaint is with the ending here comes the biggest spoiler skip this paragraph if you don t want to learn it . a few minutes before it ended, there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered. the way it got discovered was in a sting operation, but my question is how did the police get convinced to go along with it the movie didn t show us that, and it seemed a bit too convenient absent the explanation of how they were persuaded to do it. br br i think the way they handled that was done for dramatic purposes, as the omission of the explanation lent an aura of suspense to the crucial scene which otherwise wouldn t have been there we would already have known what the scene was about, and what was going on with brad in it . br br otherwise, this is a pretty good film i give it . it made me think. now i m interested to find out the facts of the real case. br br one more thing the movie was done in . some of the reviews here seem to be treating it as a more recent movie. br br p.s. meadow sisto is lovely. i hadn t seen her before. she can act a little, too always a plus in her line of work, lol .\n",

            "Review: for years i thought this knockabout service comedy was a product of john ford, especially with victor mclaglen as one of the leads. it certainly has the same rough house humor that ford laces his films with. br br to my surprise i learned it was george stevens who actually directed it. still i refuse to believe that this film wasn t offered to john ford, but he was probably off in monument valley making stagecoach. br br victor mclaglen along with cary grant and douglas fairbanks, jr., play three sergeants in the indian army who have a nice buddy buddy buddy camaraderie going. but the old gang is breaking up because fairbanks is engaged to marry joan fontaine. not if his two pals can help it, aided and abetted by regimental beastie gunga din as played by sam jaffe. br br the rudyard kipling poem served as the inspiration for this rko film about barracks life in the british raj. the comic playing of the leads is so good that it does overshadow the incredibly racist message of the film. not that the makers were racist, but this was the assumption of the british there at the time, including our leads and gunga din shows this most effectively. br br the british took india by increments, making deals here and there with local rulers under a weak mogul emperor who was done away with in the middle of the th century. they ruled very little of india outright, that would have been impossible. their rule depended on the native troops you see here. note that the soldiers cannot rise above the rank of corporal and gunga din is considerably lower in status than that. br br note here that the rebels in fact are hindu, not moslem. there are as many strains of that religion as there are christian sects and this strangling cult was quite real. of course to those being strangled they might not have the same view of them as liberators. but until india organized its independence movement, until the congress party came into being, these people were the voice of a free india. br br but however you slice it, strangling people isn t a nice thing to do and the british had their point here also. when i watch gunga din, i think of star trek and the reason the prime directive came into being. br br cary grant got to play his real cockney self here instead of the urbane cary we re used to seeing. fairbanks and mclaglen do very well with roles completely suited to their personalities. br br best acting role in the film however is eduard ciannelli as the guru, the head of the strangler cult. note the fire and passion in his performance, he blows everyone else off the screen when he s on. br br favorite scene in gunga din is ciannelli exhorting his troops in their mountain temple. note how stevens progressively darkens the background around ciannelli until all you see are eyes and teeth like a ghoulish halloween mask. haunting, frightening and very effective. br br it was right after the action of this film in the late nineteenth century that more and more of the british public started to question the underlying assumptions justifying the raj. but that s the subject of gandhi. br br gunga din is still a great film, entertaining and funny. it should be shown with a passage to india and gandhi and you can chart how the indian independence movement evolved.\n",

            "Review: this is possibly one of the worst movies i have had the dis pleasure of watching in my entire life. the plot is ridiculous and the characters are horrible people. i watched this film with friends and we all agreed to turn it off minutes before the end. ben kingsley s character is just plain stupid but not funny at all. it is a wonder why an actor of his talent would be involved in such tripe. tea leoni does a fine hillary clinton impression throughout to portray the very cold and uninteresting female lead who has all the endearing qualities of a broom handle. throw in a pointless and unexplained sub plot and a horribly cringe worthy montage, and you end up with a waste of minutes in my case . avoid this film at all costs \n",

            "Review: i m . bruce was the man in evil dead, and i still love to watch ed and ed . it was cool also to see him as the king two or three years ago in bubba ho tep in which he showed versatility and great acting talent. but this screaming brain adventure is certainly not for bruce s early fans. either i m getting too old for this sh , or i m just not part of bruce s target audience anymore. i m positive kids age to will love this film. but this over extended sci fi comedy contains about minutes total of interesting moments, and the rest is cheap kids slapstick humor. campbell better talk seriously with sam raimi and get their brains screaming together for a last evil dead reunion picture to get back my interest. at least there would be a good director behind the camera... sorry bruce, this just doesn t cut it for me. take care.\n",

            "Review: i was very willing to give rendition the benefit of the doubt when it came to all the negative press i had read concerning it. even about three quarters of the way through, i still thought it was jumbled and a bit incoherent, but otherwise a solid tale reaching its conclusion. and then the bottom fell out. not wanting to necessarily ruin the film for anyone, but the conclusion flips everything you held to be fact about what and when things have been happening on its no particular reason whatsoever except to maybe tell the world, yeah i m cool, and i know it. i love a good twist, i love a good ah ha moment, but only when it is relevant to the story at hand. the complete misguidance on the part of the filmmakers serves no purpose on the overall tale, timelines didn t need to be parallel and they didn t need to be separated by a week. all the revelation did was destroy any merit i was about to give director gavin hood and screenwriter kelley sane, which may be a good thing, because looking back, it wasn t really as solid a movie as i initially was going to blindly give it credit for. br br it is an admirable thing to try and get the term rendition out into the film going public s consciousness, but it needed a story that delved deeper into the connotations and politics involved, rather than gloss over those issues for a tale of a woman in distress over her husband s disappearance and the angst filled rebellion of a daughter against her interrogator father. i understand that the bottom line film attendee needs a human quality to grasp onto and for that reason i don t fault it for going that route. my only qualm is that we don t get enough of what the title says we should be getting. instead we are shown numerous plot lines, all confusingly brought to the forefront before being sent back into the nether regions of our consciousness, never to be returned to. so much is going on that you forget what you are supposed to be caring for, the wife the interrogator the cia agent the victim the senator the middle eastern daughter and her zealot boyfriend at the end i really just gave up and let the film take me where it would, which ended up being someone totally different than what it first laid out. br br everything that occurs happens as the result of a bomb explosion. this bomb is at the center of every story thread and finally ends up being so innocuous that you can t believe how huge the waves it spread were. the old butterfly wings flapping quote is in full effect, because one boy s mission for revenge ends up destroying the lives of so many. whether by death, destruction, physical and emotional abuse, or career suicide no one really escapes unscathed. however, at the end of the day, only the story about the man who has been excised to egypt for torture is really interesting. we are led to believe he is unequivocally innocent from the start, yet he is waterboarded, electrocuted, etc. in order to extract any information he might have. when those in power include a man with no compassion or reason to stop until something is spilled, whether true or not , and an observer without the guts to partake or stop it, the situation lends itself some intrigue as to how it could possibly end. the three actors involved all are the best parts of the film and prove once more that the movie should have concerned itself with them for the entirety. br br i don t want to belittle people like reese witherspoon, the victim s wife , or her senate employed ex, played by peter sarsgaard, because they actual do a good job with what they are given. even meryl streep, her kooky accent, and alan arkin don t detract too much. however, it is the trio of jake gyllenhaal s cia agent, yigal naor s interrogator, and omar metwally s victim that truly shine. naor is brilliant as the egyptian trying to stay sharp as a razor during working hours yet compassionate and worry filled as a father attempting to locate his daughter. this man is brutal, but he is because that is what his occupation calls for and why he is relied upon to find answers. metwally never gives a false second during the pain and suffering inflicted upon him. whether he is lying or truly knows nothing about the terrorist who has been calling his cell phone, we totally buy into his plight and desperately wait to see how the situation turns out. as for gyllenhaal, someone who seems to have one performance recycled throughout his career with varying degrees of success, he finds a part that suits him. the demons entering his soul throughout the ordeal he is forced to be a part of wear on his body and mind, causing both ambivalence and a need to intervene. the two feelings wrestle with each other until he makes a final decision, and his stoic, boyish demeanor suit that battle perfectly. br br it is just too bad that the one plot line working never finds itself as the main focal point, despite being the namesake of the film. with all the clutter around the edges, we as an audience get bounced around too much, lulled into a sense of time and sequence, and then slapped in the face as it all unravels in more of a laugh on us then a, bet you didn t see that coming. i felt cheated and unfortunately that is the lasting effect i have taken from the movie. had it been more straightforward i might have enjoyed myself more, but as is, one can still take some positives from the severely flawed whole.\n",
